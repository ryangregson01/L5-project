As you'll recall these were:\n","\n","a) to get the BLM to withdraw any \"interim\" policies, the first of which \n","split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications, and a later version \n","that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each \n","time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a \n","retroactivity clause that added extra sting;\n","b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed \n","its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual \n","\"comparable\" assessments (the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees \n","in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, \n","increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold);\n","c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY \n","2001; and\n","d) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested \n","stakeholders, including Enron.\n","\n","Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the \n","Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from \n","points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d.   The language we \n","inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the \n","Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee \n","schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and \n","forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for \n","future rent determination.\n","\n","The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is \n","because the issue still hasn't quite closed.  The Interior Appropriations \n","Bill may very well be vetoed.  But since our issue was settled at the staff \n","level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being \n","re-examined and challenged.  In fact, any changes would likely only increase \n","the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert \n","even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the \n","agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next \n","18 months.  Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive \n","discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged \n","agreements on timing and specific ways forward.   Details are forthcoming, \n","but Enron would be involved closely in the process.  The agencies were \n","clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to \n","negotiate.\n","\n","But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from \n","implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process \n","either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal \n","year.  And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and \n","organizing and leading the 20-member  Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way \n","Coalition, we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the \n","communications field. \n","\n","Steve\n","\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL pdc: Prediction: 1 .

The following \n","developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but \n","our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under \n","control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far.\n","\n","Developments:\n","\n","House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any \n","further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to \n","appropriations, \"omnibus\" or other must-pass measures.   They are somewhat \n","angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps. \n","Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote \n","against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage \n","under suspension of the rules.\n","\n","Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for \n","killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly \n","promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning \n","in House Democrats.   Senator Patty Murray called the White House and \n","expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for \n","Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.   \n","\n","In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions \n","from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that \n","package on an omnibus or appropriations bill.   Sources close to Rep. Dingell \n","indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping \n","up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to \n","accept tougher provisions.\n","\n","Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting \n","any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to \n","changing the Senate bill at all.   However, Senator Murray and Republican \n","Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to \n","pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations \n","bill.    \n","\n","The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the \n","House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if \n","no legislation passes at all.  It is unclear what could or would be contained \n","in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it \n","would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.  We are working with \n","sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.\n","\n","Strategy going forward:\n","\n","Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing \n","\"what industry could live with\" in terms of provisions added to the Senate \n","bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an \n","approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the \n","Senate bill and only the Senate bill.   It was approved unanimously in the \n","Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an \n","omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.  Consistent with \n","what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the \n","Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting \n","pieces of it as a compromise.\n","\n","We will be shoring up support for our position of \"if anything moves forward, \n","it should be the Senate bill only\" with Senate supporters and leadership in \n","the House and Senate.  We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who \n","supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in \n","case their vote becomes an issue.   In support of Senator Gorton's election \n","troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that \n","support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder \n","the blame for the bill's defeat.  In particular, we are hopeful that Senator \n","McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can \n","be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the \n","Senate bill.\n","\n","Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last \n","minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and \n","subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the \n","session is over (which now could be as late as October 20).  \n","\n","I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.\n","\n","Jeff\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL pdc: Prediction: 1 .

The\n","Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such  an\n","action, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the\n","Constitution itself.

If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night,\" Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. \n","The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began. \n","Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. \n","But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. \n","Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. \n","The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. \n","\"This is real goofy,\" Leno said before taping got under way. \"We'll see what happens.\" Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. \n","Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, \"This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence.\" \n","Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. \n","While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs. \n","Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, \"I've been operating in the dark for years.\" \n","Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. \n","\"It was cool,\" said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La. \"The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights.\" \n","Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, \"It was a good idea and a great way to make a point.\" \n","The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio. \n"," \n","___________________________________\n","Contact Information\n","E-mail\n","kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net \n","Phone\n","(213) 926-2626\n","Fax\n","(707) 516-0019\n","Traditional Mail\n","PO Box 21074 ?Los Angeles, CA 90021\n","___________________________________\n"," \n"," - image001.jpg \n"," - image001.jpg \n","Purely Personal\n","Message-ID: <2043960.1075847602151.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\n","Date: Tue, 10 Apr 2001 00:34:00 -0700 (PDT)\n","From: steven.kean@enron.com\n","To: kean@rice.edu\n","Subject: to cheer up the day\n","Mime-Version: 1.0\n","Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n","Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n","X-From: Steven J Kean\n","X-To: kean@rice.edu\n","X-cc: \n","X-bcc: \n","X-Folder: \\Steven_Kean_June2001_1\\Notes Folders\\All documents\n","X-Origin: KEAN-S\n","X-FileName: skean.nsf\n","\n","---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 04/10/2001 \n","07:34 AM ---------------------------\n","   \n","\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.\n","\t\n","\tFrom:  Sherri Sera                           04/09/2001 08:31 PM\n","\t\n","\n","To: \n","cc:  (bcc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron)\n","\n","Subject: to cheer up the day\n","\n","A few more...\n","\n","\n","\n"," - pauserefreshes.jpg\n"," - niceartlady.jpg\n"," - noparking.jpg\n"," - ouch.jpg\n"," - bad2thebone.jpg\n"," - raceincentive.jpg\n"," - rockclimber.jpg\n"," - sorryflowers.jpg\n"," - touristattraction.jpg\n"," - whichwaytogo.jpg\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Purely Personal\n","Message-ID: <26655739.1075847602175.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\n","Date: Tue, 10 Apr 2001 00:33:00 -0700 (PDT)\n","From: steven.kean@enron.com\n","To: kean@rice.edu\n","Subject: Some funnies\n","Mime-Version: 1.0\n","Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n","Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n","X-From: Steven J Kean\n","X-To: kean@rice.edu\n","X-cc: \n","X-bcc: \n","X-Folder: \\Steven_Kean_June2001_1\\Notes Folders\\All documents\n","X-Origin: KEAN-S\n","X-FileName: skean.nsf\n","\n","---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 04/10/2001 \n","07:33 AM ---------------------------\n","   \n","\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.\n","\t\n","\tFrom:  Sherri Sera                           04/09/2001 08:26 PM\n","\t\n","\n","To: \n","cc:  (bcc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron)\n","\n","Subject: Some funnies\n","\n","\n","-Had to share these...SRS\n","\n","\n"," - airolane.jpg\n"," - bombtech.jpg\n"," - fortune.jpg\n"," - hotdog.jpg\n"," - watchp.jpg\n"," - newad.jpg\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Personal but in professional context\n","Message-ID: <19367921.1075847581373.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\n","Date: Tue, 15 May 2001 11:48:00 -0700 (PDT)\n","From: steven.kean@enron.com\n","To: linda.robertson@enron.com\n","Subject: HELP!!!\n","Cc: sherri.sera@enron.com\n","Mime-Version: 1.0\n","Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\n","Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n","Bcc: sherri.sera@enron.com\n","X-From: Steven J Kean\n","X-To: Linda Robertson\n","X-cc: Sherri Sera\n","X-bcc: \n","X-Folder: \\Steven_Kean_June2001_1\\Notes Folders\\All documents\n","X-Origin: KEAN-S\n","X-FileName: skean.nsf\n","\n","Linda - I haven't heard of these guys.
