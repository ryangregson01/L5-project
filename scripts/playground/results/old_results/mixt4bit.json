I'm still awaiting additional suggestions fromanyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things. If the business school wants to go forwardwith a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeffhas said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen, what do you think?I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chiefeconomist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanfordeconomist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more thananyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,Australia, and California. He speaks a mile a minute though and hisunderstanding of policy and politics is a bit naive. I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute. I heard from MichaelBerg this morning. So he will not be participating in our discussions either. My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school. One positive outcome ofthis would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notcheconomic policy faculty. Overshadowing is possible. Lee, does Dean Nacht havea view on joint sponsorship?Rob\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Perhaps you can forward this. I just received a phone call from Carl Shapiro. He began by saying that he and several people from the Business School (Severin Borenstein, George Cluff) are planning an electricity deregulation mini-conference that sounds exactly like ours, and wanted to check so that we don't step on each others toes and perhaps can do it together. They even had October in mind for their timing. We are further along then they are, however. My first response to him was that because our event is alumni-initiated, I am not sure that they would want this to be other than a GSPP event. By the end of our conversation, we were discussing GSPP co-sponsorship with two other campus units: IBER and UEI. Neither are schools. Carl is Director of the Institute for Business and Economics Research, a campus-wide organized research unit (and Rich Gilbert assists in this). UEI is Severin's group, the university-wide energy research institute. Carl suggested that they could help with administration and perhaps some modest support if we do this together. Carl himself is on the Market Surveillance Committee of the ISO, and I think would hope to have some speaking role. He also mentioned Frank Wolak of Stanford as a speaker. I think it would be good to try and work out this co-sponsorship. It would mean allowing some of them (Carl and Severin?) into our planning group. There connections are probably very valuable to us, and they really are on the same wavelength. The alternative of GSPP going it alone after this initiative seems to me to be bad feelings and crossed-wires that would be no good to anyone. Reactions? Lee\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Classify text among sensitive, not sensitive.\n\n---\n\nFollow the following format.\n\nQuestion: ${question}\nAnswer: The classification label, either 'sensitive' or 'not sensitive'.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard. We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates. On transparency, Leon understands our concerns. In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information. We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC. We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form. We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute. Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections. This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff. (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler). Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind. Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under \"information required\" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows: (2) each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy. By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc. As to the \"timely basis\" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day. If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily. That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think. Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway: \"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate. The change is to add \"appropriate\" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable. The use of \"appropriate\" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like \"consistent with ...\" or \"promote competition\" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability. There should be some valid purpose established before data is released. I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate. Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill. Will provide a further report on market-based rates. In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments. We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets. His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets. We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down. Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.\nAnswer: sensitive"

One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended for CA Large Consumers. Nader sent someone. No other consumers. One other ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The prices are quite divergent. He expresses concern at the little offered.Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate increase.Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enoughEnron able to take low profile.SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing could be achieved.Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed epithets at SDG&E and SCE. SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning. Out of the Room Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable resolution. Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Judge asked everyone to consider how to \"Share the Pain\" for Thursday's meeting and said not to expect any \"win:win\" scenario. His view is that FERC is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates. Generators oppose this, I believe.Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza. In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year. Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM. In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on the company's liquidity position. Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The same could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall \"guidance\" question. Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

All rights reserved. Copyright Cato Institute Spring 2001 THE FINAL WORD CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on \"negawatts\" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the \"Information Economy\" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. \"Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,\" Davis declaimed. \"Take\" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. Californians want to snatch that money back. \"Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,\" reported the January 31 Washington Post. \"They took the money and ran,\" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. It would be wrong to call Californians stupid.

Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control \"path 15\"? Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E? Are there other examples and are there links between these \"preferences\" and the current problems in California? As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us.\nAnswer: The classification label for this text is 'sensitive"

As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE inresponse to our data requests, review of an \"Executive Summary\" prepared byGeorge Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday,EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, didindeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time periodclaimed by SCE. This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (althoughinterrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is thesubject matter of its counterclaim. First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) chargesto the market. In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during thelast quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the \"cost to themarket\" from the EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day aheadmarket clearing price to the individual hourly variances. This cost tothe market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account thefact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accountsto get a net amount of underreporting. This underreported amount is thenallocated to all providers of physical load within a service territorythrough the assessment of UFE charges. Thus whatever the ultimate cost wasdetermined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount. Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, inSCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased. Thisclaim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market inthe way of UFE charges. What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES andEEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy whichthey reported to the ISO. EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more thanthe amount which EES and EEMC reported. SCE calculated the PX credit basedon the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC arenot entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC,purchased those volumes. It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter ofSCE's counterclaim. SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PXcredit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase. SCEis claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO. WhileSCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the resultof EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of itscounterclaim. Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece ofinformation to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreportingof volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DAcustomers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim? and do wehave data to back it up? Jeanne Bennett\nAnswer: sensitive"

There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues. One of them exludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, specifically including connection fees. In the example in the e-mail, the issue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that are then transferred to the utility. Will check on that angle. In any event, Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdiction of Barton's subcommittee. Instead, the tax title would have to go through the Ways and Means Committee. There were some energy tax provisions in the House-passed energy bill last August. Chris and I will consult tomorrow to see if this issue was included in that bill. Aside from the tax issue, Barton bill would require the type of interconnection rulemaking that FERC is now conducting (both for connections to local distribution and to transmission). In each case, the cost of interconnection would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly situated. I will go back to double check, but off the top of my head I recall that the Bingaman draft specifically \"socializes\" the costs of interconnection. John\nAnswer: not sensitive"

ERCOT will present its agreement and procedures and EPSA will present a list of problems that members have had. Enron worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs. EEI will also make a presentation. (Additionally, as you are probably aware, over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotline and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconnection issues -- this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issues.) At the end of the Nov. 1 meeting, other meeting participants will have a brief amount of time to raise issues. Donna Fulton will attend for Enron. FERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interconnection procedures and parts of an IA (results due to FERC Dec 14). We will then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec. 21. FERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings; therefore, it will most likely not be dealing with the tax gross-up and crediting issues yet. It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rulemaking. (We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most problematic part of interconnection negotiations, but this is the way FERC wants to proceed. FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders when disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecuted.) By way of background on ERCOT, as I understand it, ERCOT basically rolls in the interconnection costs (network-type upgrades) to the entire grid through TCOS (an uplift). However, TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited -- ERCOT has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the best interest of the grid. Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT to this method. We will need to formulate Enron's view in the next phase of the interconnection proceeding. For Thurs. meeting, I think Donna should raise these issues:-- While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminate the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and over, the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business circumstances (for example, the notice to proceed that we have been including.) -- While having timelines and procedures are fine, the larger problem has been getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures (for example, Entergy was one of the first to file procedures, yet seems to have a problem sticking to their timelines.) This yet again means that RTOs are critical to stop the discriminatory practices and to provide incentives to treat us as customers. --There needs to be more discussion on best practice No.2 below -- Energy resource or capacity resource. This should be reviewed in the context of FERC's NOPR on icap (Enron just submitted comments that \"capacity\" as a separate payment is not necessary in functioning markets. In addition, \"capacity\" is not a separately required \"payment\" in most parts of the US outside of current ISOs (ERCOT does not have icap)). Attached is the ANOPR, ERCOT IA and procedures. Susan Lindberg will be circulating a draft of Enron comments on the agreement and procedures. Included on p. 11 of the ANOPR are \"best practices\" which include: 1. Comparable treatment for IPPs (allowed to be competing network resources for load without having to be designated as a \"network\" resouce)2. Multiple interconnection products: Energy resource and capacity resource3. Small generator exemption4. Queueing with reasonable milestones (10 days to correct deficiencies)5. Deposits (with deposits over actual cost refunded)6. Siting: TPs would post optimal and non-optimal sites for locating generators (this is something that we had asked some new ITCs to provide. Most TPs have been reluctant to provide this service.)7. Timelines (very similar to currently approved timelines) Please provide any thoughts/comments to Susan Lindberg, Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel and me. Thanks. Christi 37007\nAnswer: sensitive"

Although I did not see the word \"congestion\", the implication of what I read is that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion impacts that it makes on the grid. The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in \"but for\" the new generator. That is great, assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude. Did I? I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgotten about until recently. That is, if the generator pays for all of this upgrade and \"but for\" stuff, and then \"gives\" it to the utility, are there taxes due on the \"gift\"? When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the taxes on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned over to the state and fed. (This is potentially A LOT of money to \"waste\" on an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.) Working with Enron's tax dept (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming. (We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.) I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was considering. (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.) The point of all of this. Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection to address the tax issue? Is it too late? Is it irrelevant to the FERC process? Does anyone know the status of the law making process? I am concerned about taxes for two reasons. First, many of the opponents to the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and included in rate base. (In other words, \"all generators are good and benefit the ratepayers.\") On fundamental grounds they will resist paying for upgrades. If they believe that they will get the insult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades), they will resist the NOPR more strenously. (FYI to everyone, Calpine strongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it. And guess what? Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problems around all of the projects, just as we forecasted. ISO is now considering adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion. Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the grid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt. Because all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we supported the approach in the proposed NOPR.) Second, perhaps naively, I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades. On a project we are now developing in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system upgrades in PG&E's system. Significant grossups for tax impacts of the \"gift\" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmission system upgrades. Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nice if we could get some appropriate precedence going. Any possibliity of dealing with the tax issues in this NOPR?\nAnswer: sensitive"

Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and \"impermanent\" because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone). This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication. We now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML format on company intranet sites. I suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training) and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization\nAnswer: not sensitive"

A list of those who have been interviewed or have been part of a focus group on this subject. The input from individuals on this list will be the basis for developing the 5-7 key scenarios that will be a part of the training. Please let me know if you feel we should include more people from your unit to insure that your unit's unique circumstances are appropriately taken into account. If so, let us know either their names or how you would like them to be identified. Some of the individuals on this list will be contacted as Subject Matter Experts to help provide real Enron contexts for the scenarios as they are further developed. 2. A list of the \"first draft\" objectives for the program and 10 possible scenarios. Since we will only be able to have a total of about 5-7 scenarios in the final version, identify the 5 - 7 on this list of high level scenario ideas that will have the most impact on improving communications and the most applicability to a range of managers across the Enron organization. Any other feedback you can provide on the objectives or scenarios would be greatly appreciated. We are seeking to move forward with the development of scenarios by the beginning of next week. Therefore, if you could provide your feedback on both of the items above by Friday, August 18th, it would be greatly appreciated. Dick Amabile\nAnswer: not sensitive"

However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us. Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a. At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables. As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty. I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers. The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business. These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding. Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount. I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us. It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding. Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Currently the following 4 are employed through Enron Metals & Commodity Corp and by default receive all Enron benefits under our US plans. Martha Horne Isoji (David) Sato Mary Buck Daisy Leung The main reason they were hired through Enron Metals was due to the fact that a US Henry Bath company had not been set up that could provide benefits and payroll. Prior to Enron's arrival all Henry Bath employees were employed by a third party professional employer organization called Worldtec Group International. All other HB employees continue to be employed and receive benefits from Worldtec. I've attached some additional information about Worldtec as well as a copy of the POE Service Agreement executed by Martha Horne (for HB) and T.G. Plate (for Worldtec).\nAnswer: sensitive"

Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales ManagerHouston, TX#(713)-439-5587(Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX#(713)-439-5555(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle, Solution Control ManagerSoutheast RegionAustin, TX (#(512)-257-5735(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliancesAustin, TX#(512)-257-5736(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services SolutionsCupertino, CA#(408)-447-5240(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt, On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward. I'd definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply in the very near future. I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably linked. Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg understand that his focus was different than ours. Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process. I have certainly found her involvement invaluable. Patrick Matt Harris 12/14/00 10:51 AM\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The RED Index, which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by22 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets, todayreleased the U.S. rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia,in a 187 page report. Key results included: 1. Pennsylvania 66 2. Texas 65 3. New York 64 4. Maine 62 17. California 34 \"These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation onwhich electric competition can grow,\" said Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center. \"While California's crisis has brought a lot of positive attention toPennsylvania's model, many customers in the Keystone State are returning totheir original utility suppliers. It underscores how important it is to putthe right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefitover the long haul,\" Malloy said. In rankings that included all of North America, the province of Albertaactually would rank above all the states with a score of 68. The mid-year RED Index also found that 62% of states expressing an opinionindicated that their commission is not \"less likely to take action on energyrestructuring as a result of the California crisis.\" CAEM is an independent, nonprofit, think tank based in Washington, DC whosemission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to thecompetitive model of regulation.

We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.=01; In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary. The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.=01; Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we're still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, or if it is against government.=01; Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow.=01; Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold.=01; The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void.=01; We're watching this situation closely.=01; The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational situation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and will notify the Enron Crisis team. We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network.=01; The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply.=01; I've notified all relevant government authorities of the situation, and so far am getting support.=01; I've also asked the Embassy to look into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful. Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.=01; Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano, we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.=01; We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon as our people complete the overall plan.

It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments. Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an \"informational\" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee. It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments. From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then. The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill. There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate. Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today. It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day. Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers. In short, a very bad bill.Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day. Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes). What people don't know:Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time. Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley. Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort. Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded efforts. What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy. Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time. Thanks. Mike\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Also, who do you suggest for a witness on this, or will affidavits be sufficient? Need your input on this, since we may have to do additional research and now is the time to do it before the August 13 prehearing conference. Thanks!

However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us. Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a. At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables. As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty. I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers. The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business. These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding. Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount. I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us. It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding. Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS. The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register. If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals) Two (2) negotiators - Contract ManagersTwo (2) analystsTwo (2) contract administrators The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC: iBuyit SystemCatalog system (part of iBuyit)iPayit system We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department. This would take very few staff adds to make that happen. Let me know if you need any further detail. Morris (713) 503-1409\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The amount of the waived forfeiture penalty is added to that individuals income as salary (imputed income) and is subject to Federal, State, and FICA taxes. V&E and I recommend that the changes are effective as of now and not retroactive back to the start of the plan.

Please refer to the original language : Reason for this email: Gain consensus on this change Business Issue : Find alternatives to the PC forfeiture penalty when an employee who has participated in the Clickathome program is involuntarily terminated due to business reorganizations. Proposed Alternative : Replace the cash forfeiture penalty with imputed income to be reported on year-end W-2. The alternative defers or removes the cash impact to the employee. Employees moving to other Enron units who currently do not participate in the program such as PGE and EFS will not be required to report the PC as imputed income as long as they remain in a wholly-owned division. New Process : Requires payroll administration Timing: Effective immediately. Question: Do you want this retroactive to program inception? Other Applications: The imputed income option could be expanded to all types of terminations. However, in doing so, would allow easier entry into the program when an employee is planning to leave the company voluntarily. No recommendation at this time to change the forfeiture penalty for these other types of separations. Please email me with your vote as Kalen is interested in enacting this change as soon as possible for the current redeployment candidates. Thanks.\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

We're also looking to increase your exposure with employees. We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a couple of weeks ago. It's called \"Jeff's Corner\" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 99.9% of our employees. This is how it will work. We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking about what's top of mind at that moment. The tone and style will be like your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and conversational. We suggest the first topic be \"The State of Enron.\" There is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about the widespread re-deployment efforts. These recent events are beginning to affect morale. Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year. You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force. Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost. We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly. The nice thing about this medium is we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you speak to employees gives the message credibility. Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc. We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to discuss. I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this now. I will check your calendar with Sherri. Let me know if you have any questions. Mary\nAnswer: not sensitive"

There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants. In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol. The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows: 21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda. By company, they are broken down as follows: Enron India - eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine. These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants. We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger. As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon season has started. A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources. As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable. We are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there. Dave\nAnswer: sensitive"

Davis Committee News ReleaseThe Committee on Energy and CommerceW.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin,? Chairman Chairmen Tauzin, Barton Urge Gov. DavisTo Respond Immediately to Inquiries Washington (July 11) =01) House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis: July 11, 2001The Honorable Gray Davis Governor State of California State Capitol Sacramento, California 95814 Dear Governor Davis: As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist California in resolving its energy supply crisis.? One of these measures was a temporary =01&safe harbor=018 provision, effective only upon the California Governor=01,s request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act. During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held on the California electric crisis, including two hearings on draft legislation, Members of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge, even with written =01&agreements=018 for extended operation between state air officials and the powerplants.? Nevertheless, California officials testifying or providing information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary. I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate.? On June 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against three electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero power plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emergency extended operation.? On the same day, the City and County of San Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against the three Potrero units.? All parties involved in the litigation strongly assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all available legal remedies under federal and state law. The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal air permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars.? Understandably, as a result of this potentially huge fine, the operator of the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three generating units, even during periods of electrical emergency.? Thus, the mere filing of this lawsuit could have a near-term impact of the amount of power available in California. Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substantial amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities in California could also be subject to similar legal action.? The California Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 megawatts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of operation.? In addition, several new units are being brought on-line this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment.? According to incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prior to this summer=01,s peak demand period.? These units may represent up to 2% of generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Stage III electric emergency. Although presented with written requests for information from the Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could not or would not provide the Committee with precise information on units that may have been off-line due to permit limits, a projection of the number of generating units that will face permit constraints that could cause such units to be off-line, the amount of generation associated with these facilities, the possible impact of these units on system reliability, and additional information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operating under =01&modified=018 conditions. We believe that in the face of the pending legal action, it is even more important that such information be accurately and objectively determined. As we mentioned above, over several months in the spring and early summer of this year, the Committee sought California=01,s support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of certain powerplants.? Regrettably, the Committee did not receive any support from your administration for such changes to the law, as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this letter.? Instead, witnesses representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary -- even if it could only be granted during periods of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).? It appears now that citizen groups in California -- as well as the City and County of San Francisco -- do not believe that the actions taken by you, your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal.? The pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previously claimed granted sufficient legal =01&flexibility=018 to keep these units running during times of emergency.? It is time, then, to reconsider this issue. So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critical situation and respond accordingly, we would ask for your consideration of the following: (1) We would urge you to reply fully to the Committee=01,s earlier requests that CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act.? We should have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk. (2) In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are now being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act, we ask whether you will now favor creating in federal law a limited, environmentally-neutral safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to EPA. (3) Finally, we would ask that if you support such legislation, that you work with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this summer. Thank you in advance for your consideration of our requests.Sincerely,W.J.

I do think we need to talk this through. In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved. As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate. In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America. Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process. Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes. In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media. I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation. As an executive committee, we elected to make such an exception only for \"legacy\" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process.

I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years. 1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here. 3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes. I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account the specifc business unit and/or global function needs. Wade\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I am still awaiting Dick and Michelle's impressions of the below, but also look forward to your impressions and input. Likewise I would appreciate your input on whether or not we need to change the ratings on the feedback forms to numerical ratings 1-5 to mimic the clusters. look forward to hearing from you, Many thanks, Gina---------------------- Forwarded by Gina Corteselli/Corp/Enron on 09/14/2000 05:54 PM ---------------------------\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

I tried to apply the information you provided and to describe qualities of an employee's performance . I'm not sure whether this is any better, but would appreciate your input. What I am finding most challenging writing descriptors which are interchangeable with all levels and job groups within the company. The behaviors these describe and measure need to be general in nature so that they can apply to a VP and an admin assistant, as well as to all four Peer Groups within Enron. Likewise, I would appreciate your thoughts on the necessity/value of changing the feedback forms to reflect the same numerical ratings. presently the feedback forms use the same descriptors as the cluster (i.e. Superior - Issues). In your opinion should these also be 1-5 ratings with one = to highest and 5= to lowest in scale? I look forward to hearing your thoughts and impressions. You may either e-mail me or call me on 713 345-3377.

Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness). I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits: Witness designations are preliminary. 1.

This filing is in response to the language in theFERC San Diego Order which suggested that the FERC believes the CAISO shouldhave this authority. Clearly, this raises issues about the role of theCAISO in the forward markets as a policy matter, but FERC is likely toapproved this authority anyway. The CAISO Board is addressing this matter as part of its ComprehensiveMarket Reform Project. The CAISO Board at the September 7 meeting deferredthe issues of the 2-day ahead market (as well as the policy matter of theCAISO buying forward) until the October meeting. However, later duringExecutive Session, the CAISO Board apparently approved Amendment 30. At this point in time, IEP is not planning on responding to Amendment 30.This position is primarily driven by limited funds in theRestructuring/Transmission Task Force account and, given the forces alignedin support, taking this issue up seem problematic. Please let me know ifanyone differs with this assessment and would like to see IEP comment(recognizing that funds would be required to accomplish this).\nAnswer: not sensitive"

An explanation (in draft) of the Dutch power market and the events leading up to the current market \"squeeze\" by certain players, which we have produced and discussed for our external lawyers. 2. A schematic of arguments which we produced for external lawyers before Christmas just relating to the mis-application of capacity by TenneT. 3. A copy of our e-mail to Clifford Chance of last Wednesday summarising the issues in order of priority for their advice. Please note that, purely on the swap element of this jigsaw, we are attempting to arrange a conference with a Queen's Counsel for next Monday afternoon. Hence, it may be better for our meeting (with Jeff patched-in) to take place next Tuesday - clearly the advice on all the elements involved (as set out in 3) in toto will not be complete until we have had the conference with the QC. I am due to receive tomorrow, however, from Clifford Chance their legal strategy report on all the other issues raised in my e-mail (item 3) and shall forward you a copy on receipt.

This bank account can only be accessed by any two directors of Enron Servicios signing jointly (this is my suggestion and can obviously be different). 3 - Our lawyers in Mexico will open the account and funds will be transferred forthwith. 4 - The resolution and the bank account will not be public record and no employee should know about these funds (we need to see how we can send funds to this bank account without any Mexico employee's signature) Purpose: (i) Document our legal obligations in accordance with mexican law and the reason why the shareholders of the company wish to segregate funds and (ii) make sure nobody besides the directors can access these funds. If the segregation of funds is ever challenged by ENE or ENA's creditors, we will have the legal background and justification for the segregation. If this is okay with you, I will have the various resolutions and proxies ready for signature tomorrow and the account could probably be open and funded by Thursday. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments. Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an \"informational\" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee. It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments. From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then. The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill. There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate. Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today. It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day. Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers. In short, a very bad bill.Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day. Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes). What people don't know:Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time. Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs By Rebecca Smith 09/01/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A4 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power rates to levels seen prior to deregulation . Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that commodity price. The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier. Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to schools and hospitals. In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost. Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the rate-cap measure is \"deeply flawed\" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or December 2003. Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through December 2002. \"It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,\" he said because it \"creates tremendous uncertainty\" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance new projects such as a new transmission line. The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that review the plans.

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed theprice these utilities are allowed to bill theircustomers, as currently seems likely, they could becometechnically insolvent sometime next year. That would putpressure on regulators to orchestrate amultibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the \"toobig to fail'' response that in the past pushedgovernments to rescue banks. Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-ratingconcerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks forPacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-basedPG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit ofEdison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- ratingconcerns say they aren't sure how much additional debtcan be borne by the two affected utilities before theywill have difficulty paying their bills. Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New PlantsAren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11) Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, FromDeregulation (Sept. 6) California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs(Sept. 1)\"If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities canget through it,\" says Lori Woodland, analyst for FitchIBCA. \"If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a veryserious situation.\" Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior creditofficer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: \"At somepoint, you have a financial crisis.\" The utilities say they are having no difficulty meetingexpenses and don't envision problems in servicing theirdebts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federalregulators to change the rules of the game, hopingsomehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. TheCalifornia utilities' experience may be a harbinger ofwhat could happen in other states where wholesale powerprices have surpassed the amount that utilities areallowed to charge their ratepayers. For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to thefinancial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utilitythat serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seekingapproval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping$250 million from the commercial paper market. \"This isgoing to be a long, tough road,\" says Jim Scilacci, chieffinancial officer for Southern California Edison. Today's situation represents a complete turnabout fromwhat was expected when California deregulated its energymarket on March 31, 1998, which opened electricitypricing to competition. California tried to give itsutilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulatingfaster than other states and by creating a mechanism toallow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison,to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customersunder the old regulatory system. To do this, the state legislature set retail rates athigh levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses forthe utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used itto pay down debts for generation facilities that wereotherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. Bythe end of this June, PG&E and Edison together hadcollected more than $12 billion and were on track tofinish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,rate freezes were to end and retail prices were tofluctuate with the market. But all that went out the window in June, when wholesalepower prices surged, topping the rates the utilities wereallowed to charge retail customers. Average prices atstate-sanctioned energy markets were four to five timesthe prices of a year earlier, and three to four times thelevel utilities could charge customers. The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion byOct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.Southern California Edison finished August with a deficitof $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its networth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they havebeen accumulating deficits, aren't required to reportthese as losses on their earnings statements. That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end therate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost ofelectricity to consumers. But should the freeze endbefore the statutory deadline of 2002, they getclobbered. That is because they will immediately have tobook a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What'smore, they can't use the proceeds from plannedpower-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, shouldthe freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some ofthe proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refundscould total $500 million, while in Edison's case, theamount is $254 million. Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanismwill be found to let them recoup the money spent onelectricity. Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. NettieHoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer groupUtility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end upfooting the bill for a deal cut by utilities thatbenefited them before prices shot up. Utility executives are now distancing themselves from thelegislation that got them into such a mess, which wasdrafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynnsays it is best not to \"overanalyze\" the \"old deal.\"Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sitdown with utilities and construct a new agreement, since\"it's in the broad interests of the state not to havecritical energy infrastructure look like a leper.\" Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers \"mutually assureddestruction\" to both utilities and ratepayers. Somethingmust be done, he says, or consumers throughout most ofthe state will experience \"a San Diego-style rate shock.\"The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & ElectricCo., ended its freeze a year ago and began passingwholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.Legislators intervened this summer, however, andtemporarily capped retail rates when monthly power billsnearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, isalso accumulating a deficit as a result. So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilitieswill be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analystssay. \"Until we hear politicians of consequence stateotherwise, our position is that we believe the utilitieswill be made whole,\" says Richard Cortright, a directorat Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group. But that opinion could change if it looks like theutilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result:lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs andcould trigger a downward spiral. \"You're talking abouttop-rated companies, though,\" said Ms. Woodland of FitchIBCA. \"To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen.\" In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can tocontrol the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority fromregulators to buy more power under long-term contracts atfixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-marketvolatility. And they have petitioned federal regulatorsto declare California's market so badly flawed thatgenerators should be denied market pricing and, even,ordered to pay refunds. Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remainhigh for those as well. What's more, they can't buy lesspower than their customers need. If they don't buyenough, the California Independent System Operator, theorganization responsible for reliability, will step inand make purchases for them and send them the bill. Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,though, is one of timing. The California legislature isout of session until December, and regulators haven'teven really started to address the issue formally. In themeantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens ofmillions of dollars daily.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. \"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,\" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. \"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.\"The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations.Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise.\"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,\" Wagner told reporters. \"In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment.\" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday.Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media.Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a \"joke\" that the parties might as well wear \"clown suits,\" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks.But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe.Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals.California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile \"spot market\" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say.A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a \"refund\" because the deals were reached \"under commercial duress,\" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. \"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,\" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a \"just and reasonable\" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.\"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid.Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room \"billions of dollars apart,\" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said., 2001 The Washington Post Company\nAnswer: not sensitive"

All rights reserved. Copyright Cato Institute Spring 2001 THE FINAL WORD CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on \"negawatts\" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the \"Information Economy\" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. \"Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,\" Davis declaimed. \"Take\" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. Californians want to snatch that money back. \"Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,\" reported the January 31 Washington Post. \"They took the money and ran,\" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. It would be wrong to call Californians stupid.

There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants. In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol. The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows: 21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda. By company, they are broken down as follows: Enron India - eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine. These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants. We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger. As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon season has started. A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources. As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable. We are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there. Dave\nAnswer: sensitive"

Dan McSwain 09/26/2000 KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: North County Times - Escondido, California Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) An uneasy aftermath has settled over this summer's power price shocks in San Diego County, punctuated this weekend by cool weather and falling electricity prices, as the state and federal policy-making apparatus shifts from a season of panicked damage control to the extremely difficult question of what to do next. In the parlance of the electricity industry, these are the \"shoulder\" months; a breather between periods of heavy demand for summer cooling and winter heating in which power-generating plants are typically pulled out of commission for trouble-shooting, overdue maintenance and refueling. California's pioneering deregulation of its electricity industry lies in a state of exhaustion. Guarantees from politicians of greater efficiency and lower prices have collapsed this summer into chronic power shortages and a historic transfer of wealth that in about 90 days moved $10.6 billion from the buyers of electricity to the sellers. Optimism is in short supply as a fractious collection of stakeholders and the nation's political and regulatory institutions begin to search for solutions. Emergency legislation approved by state lawmakers in August will temporarily reduce bills for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. from an average $146 in September to about $72 per month. In July 1999, San Diego County and parts of south Orange County became the first region in the nation under deregulation law to directly pay the wholesale price of electricity. Cool weather has caused demand for power to sag this weekend, bringing prices down from their lofty summer peaks to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour on Friday. But while the legislation has capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for SDGOcustomers, the utility will continue to pay the volatile wholesale cost of power, which averaged 21.4 cents this month. Historically, prices have fallen to as low as 1 cent per kilowatt in the winter months, but this year prices seem likely to exceed 6.5 cents for most of the year, and take off again in summer 2001. Analysts say generating and power marketing companies will retain their ability to raise prices, called market power, because their costs are higher and supplies of power are tight in the Pacific Northwest. SDGOsays the legislation could create a shortfall, to be financed by the company, that could run up an $800 million IOU by 2003. In the past, the Public Utilities Commission has allowed the utility to pass on such shortfalls to consumers in the form of higher rates. Pacific Gas&Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's other investor-owned utilities, have collectively lost at least $3.3 billion this summer because their retail rates have remain capped under deregulation. Both utilities are seeking to end their retail rate caps early to escape the risk of sustained high wholesale prices. Consumer groups are outraged; investors are skeptical. Three major credit rating companies said the California utilities face increased regulatory uncertainty, and the utilities' stock prices fell last week. A hot-potato mentality is emerging among policy-makers who say the authority to clamp down on market behavior has been dispersed by deregulation. California regulators and consumer advocates have great expectations for a series of state and federal investigations into the causes of higher prices and into charges of market manipulation and price gouging by power companies. Chief among them is an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that may lead to changes in California's power trading system. \"Unfortunately, we have ceded most of our authority over wholesale markets to the federal government,\" said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission, the state's top regulator. James Hoecker, the chairman of the federal commission, said Lynch overstates the case. \"California has not given me one scintilla of authority that I didn't already have,\" Hoecker said in August. The federal commission has been critical of California's approach to deregulation, but has been reluctant to intervene in interstate wholesale markets, into state trading systems, or to make aggressive use of its investigative powers. What is dawning on California policy-makers, analysts say, is the hard lesson that deregulation transfers considerable authority away from government officials and to the market participants. The challenge is to get deregulation right the first time. \"The problem is not deregulation,\" said Robert McCullough, an economist and former utility executive based in Portland, Ore. \"The problem is this Rube Goldberg device that has been constructed in California.\" The trading practices of power marketers in the West also is under scrutiny by the federal commission. Regulators informed electricity marketing companies in August that if price gouging is found, the refund of some profits may be ordered by the commission for windfall profits that are earned after mid-October. A surprising number of observers say generators have simply acted in their own interest and taken advantage of the rules to make money. Ranging from consumer advocates to economists to some regulators themselves, many say bungled deregulation is a more likely cause of high prices than a conspiracy of generating companies. \"This market has behaved very rationally this summer,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist who chairs the market surveillance committee of California's power transmission manager. \"All you need is tight supply to exercise market power in this market; you don't need collusion.\" A titanic shift is shaping up in the way power is bought on the wholesale markets on behalf of California consumers. All three utilities have been granted authority by state regulators to make confidential deals for electricity directly with individual generators or power trading companies, largely bypassing the state's nonprofit power exchange. In an equally important development, the manager of most of California's transmission system has asked federal regulators for permission to sign long-term deals for power. Up to now, the transmission manager has been limited to last-minute purchases of emergency power to stabilize the grid. Critics fear both measures are steps toward reinstating the system that existed before deregulation, in which a small number of buyers made large, long-term deals with a handful of suppliers.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of \"stepping too close to or over the line\". Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me.

Davis Committee News Release The Committee on Energy and Commerce W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin, Chairman Chairmen Tauzin, Barton Urge Gov. Davis To Respond Immediately to Inquiries Washington (July 11) - House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis: July 11, 2001 The Honorable Gray Davis Governor State of California State Capitol Sacramento, California 95814 Dear Governor Davis: As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist California in resolving its energy supply crisis. One of these measures was a temporary \"safe harbor\" provision, effective only upon the California Governor's request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act. During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held on the California electric crisis, including two hearings on draft legislation, Members of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge, even with written \"agreements\" for extended operation between state air officials and the powerplants. Nevertheless, California officials testifying or providing information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary. I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate. On June 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against three electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero power plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emergency extended operation. On the same day, the City and County of San Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against the three Potrero units. All parties involved in the litigation strongly assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all available legal remedies under federal and state law. The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal air permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars. Understandably, as a result of this potentially huge fine, the operator of the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three generating units, even during periods of electrical emergency. Thus, the mere filing of this lawsuit could have a near-term impact of the amount of power available in California. Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substantial amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities in California could also be subject to similar legal action. The California Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 megawatts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of operation. In addition, several new units are being brought on-line this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment. According to incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prior to this summer's peak demand period. These units may represent up to 2% of generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Stage III electric emergency. Although presented with written requests for information from the Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could not or would not provide the Committee with precise information on units that may have been off-line due to permit limits, a projection of the number of generating units that will face permit constraints that could cause such units to be off-line, the amount of generation associated with these facilities, the possible impact of these units on system reliability, and additional information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operating under \"modified\" conditions. We believe that in the face of the pending legal action, it is even more important that such information be accurately and objectively determined. As we mentioned above, over several months in the spring and early summer of this year, the Committee sought California's support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of certain powerplants. Regrettably, the Committee did not receive any support from your administration for such changes to the law, as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this letter. Instead, witnesses representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary -- even if it could only be granted during periods of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It appears now that citizen groups in California -- as well as the City and County of San Francisco -- do not believe that the actions taken by you, your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal. The pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previously claimed granted sufficient legal \"flexibility\" to keep these units running during times of emergency. It is time, then, to reconsider this issue. So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critical situation and respond accordingly, we would ask for your consideration of the following: (1) We would urge you to reply fully to the Committee's earlier requests that CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act. We should have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk. (2) In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are now being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act, we ask whether you will now favor creating in federal law a limited, environmentally-neutral safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to EPA. (3) Finally, we would ask that if you support such legislation, that you work with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this summer. Thank you in advance for your consideration of our requests. Sincerely, W.J.

This brought to mind a question to ask you: Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business Development Offices? I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit. Regards,Dave HubbardCuiaba, Brasil011-55-65-612-2102\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Attached are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services. These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845. EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC. For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose. People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service. EIS bills services on a one month lag. We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee. This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information. Please examine these billings for accuracy. If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative. If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".

While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others. Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access. We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise. Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

Due to press of other matters I will be brief. First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE. Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes. Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers. In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy. Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below). Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm. I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know. Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive. Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone. Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this. Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future. here are some you should be aware of: Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires). Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one. In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings. I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point. Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence. Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business. Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast. Hope this helps. I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls. P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change. I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change. Mark\nAnswer: sensitive"

The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change. Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise. At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious. Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation. As you mightexpect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as ProgramManager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging andCongestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCAfor the EMS/Market Systems. We prefer a for-profit model as it betters ouroffering and provides more near-term opportunity. Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharinginformation with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand howeach side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.

Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff. Mark did the talking. The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation. EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting. EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own. I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern. EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC \"consensus\"), but I think EPSA staff may be \"too flexible\" in how they are approaching it. I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing. EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project. It is not clear if this effort will succeed. EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA. EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can. I will check with some other EPSA members. << File: EEIDraftLegTexttoEPSA091401.doc >>\nAnswer: not sensitive"

We met at my request to discuss Barton RTO draft. (The group EPSA meeting with Chairman Barton that was to have been yesterday afternoon has been rescheduled for next Tuesday.) Key points from the meeting -- 1. They do not expect the Barton Subcommittee to mark up the electricity legislation this year. Time is running out and Members of the subcommittee are not focused on the issue. Instead, they plan to continue working on the issue at the staff level. Probably will be another draft version circulated and then a version will be introduced by Barton as a formal bill by the end of the year. The earliest they see any kind of vote is late Jan. or early February. 2. Barton feels strongly that FERC should not be the \"tail wagging the dog\" on RTO policy. 3. On particulars of the bill, they are clearly reconsidering the 40,000 MW minimum threshold for the size of an RTO. They are getting pulled in both directions, they say, and are inclined to drop the 40,000 MW number -- possibly leaving it to FERC to set a number. They conceded that the mechanics of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month \"deadline\" for all transmission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick. They consciously changed the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from \"arbitrary and capricious\" to \"preponderance of the evidence\" because they think otherwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC. Spent a lot of time on how the draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall nature of the draft assumes there are only two parties to this -- FERC and the transmission owners -- while the rest of those truly affected -- from us to others -- are left out. Sean said we could still intervene, but I said that was the truly pro forma aspect of their process since FERC's hands and our's would be tied by the \"rights\" given to transmission owners to drag their feet. Bottom line -- FERC has a window until next Spring without likely congressional interference, at least not of the formal, legislative variety, to both move on RTOs and improve its relations with Congress. FERC staff has been pushing the committee staff on concerns similar to our concerns.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is ofthe opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid becausePGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators. Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron. It seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning competitive bid. Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this process? Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely necessary. Thanks for your help. LI71299\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Let me explainwhy. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talkmore about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricingand specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJMimplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatilityand reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, thePJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deemsis out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The factthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-settingsoftware to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhatunfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that thePJM ISO decides what prices it would likefor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is nota transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buythe risk management services that Enron provides. Theonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market isthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control areato meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay theimports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on theEast Coast. This will effectively mean little importsto the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated atthe discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.It effectively kills off the development of risk management atthe wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much lessprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigatedprices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternativeform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reducesprice volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they justget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-serviceregulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-serviceprices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sourcesof benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-sideinvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management. Anecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflectactual conditions in the market (including the extent of market powerexercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for marketparticipants to make the investment necessary to management.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing. I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc). I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids. This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated. Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors. Martin\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

This case will be watched very closely because 1) it was filed against Microsoft, and 2) because of the large potential class of plaintiffs. Class action suits are an employers worst nightmare (think Texaco and Coca-Cola). Please feel free to share this with your management. ```````````````````````````````````````````````` No. 200Monday, October 16, 2000 Page A-3ISSN 1522-5968 News Discrimination Suit Filed by Microsoft Salaried EmployeeAlleges Discrimination Based on Race, Sex SEATTLE--A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp. alleging the company maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African American and female salaried employees, affecting pay rates and promotion opportunities (Donaldson v. Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, 10/4/00). Such discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the lawsuit said. The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. \"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the lawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 percent are women. Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft. \"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are \"systemic in nature, and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's operations,\" the lawsuit maintains. 'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged The complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them.\" The lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation system\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\" Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. \"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee with a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to resign, the complaint said. \"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. \"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal popularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working for different managers. In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries \"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit said. Furthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees.

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process. While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement. These items include the following: 1. Native load language2. Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3. Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4. Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5. Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking. (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance). Below is a summary of the entire settlement: 1. All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2. All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in. APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition. 3. Competitive metering and billing as described above.4. Generation is deregulated.5. PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6. Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7. RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03; best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8. Competitive bidding process for default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9. Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers. For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11. A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12. Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers. The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13. No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14. Usual licensing requirements. (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above. 16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan. Below for your information is the plan. At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order. We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.

The purpose is to allow traders to utilize the load and supply data in EMSS without the hassle of a full-blown simulation. The software would be designed to allow traders to develop a market (or supply) stack with a minimum number of keystrokes. The stacks could be developed for a utility, transarea, or region, would contain load data, and would be capable of incorporating real-time information to provide fundamental insight and market advantage. At this point in the process we are looking for ideas (and sponsors). If you think your traders might be open to the idea, I would like to talk to you and them about it, and potentially as early as next week. Please advise. Thanks,Eric\nAnswer: not sensitive"

ROCKAFELLAR Email: Mailto:rtr@math.washington.edu Postal: University of Washington Department of Applied Mathematics 408 L Guggenheim Hall Box 352420 Seattle, WA 98195-2420 USA ABSTRACT: Fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk, are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in applications because of the prevalence of models based on scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index tracking. Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios, hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management JEL Classification: G0______________________________\nAnswer: not sensitive"

CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S. In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of megawatt hours (MWh) sold. The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may be used as an introduction to options. The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW. Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability distribution for the net operating contribution including the contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives. It is instructive for the students to think about what would be the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent. This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio. Specific learning objectives of these cases include these: - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial innovation - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk - to challenge the students to value options where the Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be readily employed - to experience the perspective of top management in risk management activities.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had been expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dollar currency board. The economy ministry took a first step toward this new basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker euro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros and 50% US dollars. At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the basket. An 8% devaluation at this juncture does not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis-a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year. Initial reports indicate that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt service at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one). With such a change in currency regime as being contemplated in the Argentine Congress, investor confidence could wane if the plan is approved and as the implications of the new plan are interpreted by the market and as the sustainability of the existing currency board arrangement outside the export sector is analyzed. A loss of investor confidence will put additional pressure on the peso, pressure which has not existed previous to this new announcement by economy chief Cavallo, especially now that the government's debt swap (exchanging short-term goverment paper for longer-term bonds) has been successfully executed. As a consequence, although our forecast attached below assumes a one-for-one peso peg to the US dollar at this point to allow the quarterly revaluations to be completed in a timely fashion, this curve is subject to change upon knowledge of the Congressional vote and an analysis of the details announced with the vote as to the mechanics of this new basket regime for exporters and for the economy as a whole.

This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14. Enron Industrial MarketsOn Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk. In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations. A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement. As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States. They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.

The timing of next week's meeting to \"resolve\" the legislation reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation, along with other electricity issues, as early as the second week of September. In fact, congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess. They have pressed the \"coalition\" for a final work product. I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such, but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence, may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization. Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC, and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call), I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e., whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position, whether Enron supports an \"SRO\" type organization; and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board. Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting. For one thing, we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the \"shortened NERC\" version at the August 9th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board. My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues, our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERC's version, even the shortened one. Don't get me wrong -- we have plenty of good reasons not to, I just wasn't sure how \"engaged\" we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I gather our opposition is more fundamental (no Western deference, budget concerns, independence issues, etc.).\nAnswer: sensitive"

As we understand it, John Q Anderson agreed to give Jeff an opportunity to present present before the NERC Board some ke y issues for Enron before trying to finalize any NERC legislation proposal. Does this meeting next week preclude that presentation from occurring? Or will there be willingness to alter the language significantly enough to appease the Enron concerns next week?

By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.

Given that Jim's messages are going to be delivered this week (Denise, Jim will discuss the issue with Carraro. We intend to file a protest in ANP by Friday due to lack of responsiveness in our request for a transportation tariff)......... 1) I would not go to the press. Let it go.. 2) If asked, repeat the vision \"regional integration, based on the principles of open access, greater reliance on competition and customer choice\" 3) Monitor the response. Let me know if you are getting unfavorable reactions (other than Petrobras). 4) Jim, if you get a call ahead of your meeting, we cannot discredit Terry (The shadow of Petrobras is an unfortunate quote).

The Key message for the trip, in regards to energy, should be: \"Achieve regional integration, based on the principles of open access, greater reliance on competition and customer choice rather than regulated monopolies\" The vision is that a customer in any of the countries will have choices \"several competing providers\"; \"different service options\", and the providers will have the flexibility and agility to assemble an attractive package by combining transactions with other suppliers and customers. This approach maximizes the utilization of the existing infrastructure (reduces idle or redundant facilities) and gives customers the ability to more closely tailor their energy purchases to the their needs. There are barriers to achieve this vision. It is in the interest of the governments to work in a common protocol to progress rapidly. Development of infrastructure .- Still not well developed. Needs to attract project financing. At this stage, the customers have few alternatives. Government policy should be to allow access above and beyond what was initially contracted to justify the financing. Terms of financing have to be honored. Long term, competing facilities (pipelines, refineries, transmission lines, power plants) will be fighting for customers. Threat. Control of these facilities: Petrobras through the BBPL; YPF in Argentina Cross-border Licensing.- Very time consuming, bureaucratic delays to grant, export, import, re-export permitting. Present regime cannot accommodate the rapid transaction scenario which will be required to support real integration. Cuiaba Power plant,- As of today we have not received all the permits. Latest issue is the Bolivian-Argentina border dispute due to YPF denial to accommodate a transaction of Bolivian gas into Argentina. Operationally, the plant will receive daily instructions from Brasilia. The gas supply from Argentina/Bolivia, including spot market transaction has to be nominated within 48 hours notice. There are no mechanisms to change quickly the approved volumes. Commercial entities need to be given the opportunity to export/import to aggregate the requirements of different suppliers various customers. Taxation.- Transfer taxes (i.e. receipt taxes ,stamp taxes) for each step down the chain needs to be eliminated for commercial entities, particularly for export transactions. These commercial entities buy pieces of the services on behalf of the ultimate customer (act as their agent) and package the final offer. The objective to reduce the cost of the product, which would not be met by adding a further taxable event. There should not be more, nor any less taxes because of the services of the middle company, except for the larger amount of income taxes generated by increase commercial activity. Money Transfers.- Central Bank Controls to authorize the transfer of currency needs to be made more agile. Currently these procedures are very time consuming and cumbersome (Brazil -- I am not as familiar with the other countries) This is affecting us in Cuiaba. The Central Bank has not approved the gas contract, specifically the Take-or-pay provision that has a one-year make up period. They want a longer make-up period, but that was negotiated with YPF as part of the larger agreement. YPF may agree but at a higher price. The Central Bank does not want to send US$ out of the country, so they view TOP as a devise of paying for a commodity never received. So they are meddling in contract negotiations.

I am very comfortable with issues for Argentina and think we need to focus mainly on the stamp tax issue. Secondly, I would raise the issue of open access pipelines, especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to Argentina. The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a matter of changing the law, changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the gas to flow on it's section of pipe which I understand is not under the jurisdiction of Enargas. What can the government do? JB.- I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation, how these pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator. If it is determined that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network, in time a bypass pipeline may be built. But an immediate solution needs to be developed. In Brazil, I am not sure what to raise. On Monday we have meetings with the Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy and Mines. What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private? Myself in public? or the Minister of External Affairs? JB.- For background, the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising dollarization of their economy, \"desnacionaliza?ao\". Their concern is not the US$, it is control. It is that the Old-boys network in Brazil Government/Industry, has been disturbed by the New-boys taking control of high visibility sectors, Banking, telecommunications, energy. Malan, Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be active in direct investment and support of big projects.Complaints about BNDES (Brazilian development bank) lending to foreigners for privatization (Recent AES incident)Tourinho, Mines and Energy-- pushing a new privatization model -- sale of stock at the market, not sale of control to a given company. This allows the existing management to stay in place. If it is the Secretary of Energy, Carraro, his big mission is to coordinate the developement of emergengy thermal plants. Big Picture Governement Porgram -- Petrobras provides that gas; Eletrobras buys and remarkets the electric energy; BNDES provides the financing --- All within the family. Foreign companies will not play by the rules of the old network. Enron has been actively complaining about the gas policy under Petrobras control. The One Issue I would raise is the lack of competition in the gas sector. Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas. There cannot be true competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants, price setters, gas power plants. As a note, there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of 51% control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline. What Petrobras is doing is locking-up the capacity long term, and building a second pipeline. Of equal importance is our meeting with the Sao Paulo Governor. What issues do we have or what do you want me to say to him regarding our assets in this area. Even if it's to compliment on something, that's fine. JB.- The State of Sao Paulo, Mario Covas team are to be congratulated by the skillful manner that they have conducted the gradual privatization of energy sector. Covas is very influential. His current battle deals with tax reforms in Brazil. He is fighting a system of tax-preferences in other states to attract industries, which ultimately creates a Federal burden and consequently a Sao Paulo burden. The Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance. I assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time. JB.- There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them. I would be interested on what you pick up Thanks. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 02/15/2000 01:45 PM ---------------------------\nAnswer: sensitive"

Gostaria de saber se esta declarao faz parte de um projeto consciente da Enron em enfrentar a Petrobr?s ou se foi um descuido do porta-voz. 2. Caso a imprensa nos procure para repercutir tal declarao que, suponho, vai gerar umareao extremamente negativada Petrobr?s, existe alguma estrat,gia, key messages, etc? Vocs pretendem falar sobre o assunto? O que ser? ditoThanksDenise04. GAZETA: Energia , o alvo dos empres?rios americanosBRAS?LIA, 15 de fevereiro de 2000 - Empres?rios norte-americanos queacompanharam o secret?rio de Com,rcio, William Daley, destacaram o setor deenergiano Brasil como a principalrea para investimentos no Pa?s. Segundo ovice-presidente da Enron, Terrence Thorn, por,m, 'o monop?lio exercido pelaPetrobras? tem que acabar para que o setor se desenvolva. Todos devem competir,inclusive a estatal'.?Um dos obst?culos ,, de acordo com ele, 'a sombra que a Petrobras faz sobre omercado de energia no Brasil'. O executivo norte-americano lembra que adecis?o do governo brasileiro de estabelecer um pre?onico para o g?snatural em todo o pa?s , um claro exemplo de medidas que devem ter seus diascontados. 'Ficamos confusos ao saber de tal decis?o'. Terrence Thorn acreditaque um monop?lio estatal pode ser negativo . concorrncia e que a privatizao da Petrobras ter? que ocorrer um dia.Para ele, o processo de privatizao de energia no Brasil vem sendo conduzido de forma eficaz, 'mas o Pa?s ainda n?o concluiu o projeto de desregulamentao (liberalizar o pre?o do g?s natural, por exemplo) e h? muito trabalho pela frente'. Segundo Thorn, as empresas estrangeiras de energia podem oferecer servi?os inovadores para o setor.'O problema , que o mercado n?o est? preparado'. Ele defende que as novas fases da desregulamentao do setor energ,tico no Pa?s sejam debatidas por toda a sociedade.O interesse dos norte-americanos pelo setor p\"de ser visto na pr?pria composio da miss?o de empres?rios ao Brasil. Das 20 empresas que viajaram com Daley, dez eram do setor de energia. O representante da Agncia deDesenvolvimento e Com,rcio dos Estados Unidos (USTR), Albert Angulo, aindainformou? que org?o est? analisando cinco oportunidades de investimentos dos EUA nomercado de energia do Brasil. 'Realizamos estudos de viabilidade para que? empresa venham ao Pa?s, mas o certo , que uma maior desregulamentao dosetor energ,tico seria muito positivo para as empresas norte-americanas', diz.?A vice-presidente da empresa Energy Conversion Devices, Nancy Bacon, defendeque o governo brasileiro deixe de gastar recursos com a gerao de energiaem locais distantes e passe a comprar tecnologias alternativas dosnorte-americanos. 'Para locais de dif?cil acesso, como a Amaz\"nia, atecnologia de fotoc,lulas? , a grande soluo para suprir o d,ficit energ,tico do Brasil'.

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission. 2) Use our \"Transmission Round Table\" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy. Share this knowledge through a website to be set up. Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject. 3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer. 4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO) 5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each. 6) Go to work now!\nAnswer: not sensitive"

(2) One might think that since we are multiplying 2 random variables (i.e., Z is 2 dimensional) by the same scalar random variable (i.e., b), then the resultant random variables would tend to rise and fall together, and hence necessarily be linearly correlated. However, as is shown below, if Z is uncorrelated, then X is uncorrelated. Please note, our approach is analagous, but not identical to the Glasserman and Co papers (distributed to Research). Glasserman computes the characteristic function of the Pr(P/L > x), so to compute the entire P&L pdf he would have to repeat the procedure for every value of x. We circumvent that iterative approach (with the messy characteristic function) and compute the pdf in one shot.Please note, we are not comparing full reval vs. delta-gamma at all, that is a completely different story.

Since I am on vacation (or at least trying to be) I didn't go back into the office looking for you later in the day. The following are my last thoughts regarding Government and Reg Affairs people and organisational issues. I will leave them with you and the others do with as you like. John T. 0) Background: Cross-border issues in power and EU vs. the Germans and Dutch in Gas will likely be the big issues in the next 12 to 18 months on the continent. We have the potential to add as much value via GovRegAffairs activity on the continent in the next 12 months as through any commercial activity. Much of this activity will have to be EU focused. In power especially we have gotten almost - not quite all - but almost all that we can hope to get exclusively from national level work. (Italy and Spain are of course big exceptions.) Gas is and always has been much more of a Europe-wide theme than a national theme. We will have to carefully manage our public GRA message and approach to take tough positions without creating unneeded enemies. We should look for local national allies where possible. We cannot be the only voice in any country supporting a major position. If there are no local forces supporting the position, we need to find/create some allies. It cannot be Enron vs. Germany; or, even worse, Enron and EU vs Germany (or Switzerland, or wherever). Loss of momentum at this time would be an error; however, focus would be an accomplishment. Each issue will need a simultaneous AND co-ordinated EU and local effort. 1) Styles and the EU Office: I am convinced that Peter Styles is the most important single continent based GRA asset at this time and for the next 18 to 24 months. Everyone including me has their own stories about Peter - not all positive. But he is the right man, at the right time at the right place. Within the bounds of what is managerially and financially responsible, it is important to keep the Styles-force working for Enron at the EU level. Beyond his linguistic skills he understands absolutely what Enron needs to make money on the continent. Of course, we should begin thinking about Peter's EVENTUAL retirement. We should never allow anyone to be permanently as essential as Peter has become. BUT, right now he is essential. 2) German GRA Activities: Permanent resource (100%) should become Jan Haizmann (or however you spell it). He is abrupt and offensive to Anglo-Saxons - but then, he is very German - and the directness that some of us have come to appreciate about the Germans is often mistaken as rudeness by those who have not worked with them much. I have gotten consistently positive feed-back from senior German colleagues especially about his performance with senior German officials such as the head of the Federal Cartel Office. My understanding is that Haizmann wants to move to Frankfurt. If this is true, I would encourage it. There are no German official offices (other than the Embassy) in London. We have, I believe, all agreed that Paul Hennemeyer is more of a self-propelled project guy than a team player. Thus, I would agree that probably mid- to long-term he should move on within Enron to other Hennemeyer sized projects. But, in the immediate future, he has several very important projects going on in German speaking Europe. Additionally, with a new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up, with renewed interest in Austria and with the necessity to engage somewhat in Switzerland (regarding transit), it does not look to me like we should let Paul leave too quickly. As a somewhat mentor to Haizmann, passing off relationships in an orderly manner, ensuring that projects do not fall through the cracks, etc. there is still much for Paul to do. It will be, however, necessary to give him a clear picture of his future or Enron will lose him entirely. An open ended \"project boy\" job will not keep Paul indefinitely. Let's not lose Paul to Enron even if we have to slowly move him out of Europe. 3) Lars Atenhoefer: Lars is much in demand by Gregor and others for his unique brand of consulting based commercial work. I continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than 50% GRA front-end for Switzerland. He would be glad to do that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus. Switzerland does not/will not justify full-time GRA support; but, we must get more engaged there. Less for our Swiss business than for our cross-border business and for continued grid and water power access. The liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held. Everything going on in Switzerland now by real players is based on the failure of that vote. Important to work with Gregor and Eric to ensure that Lars continues to see a variety of opportunities in Enron. His academic and professional preparation is perfect for a GRA person. He belongs to Gregor and Eric. I recommend talking with them about him. 4) Doug Wood: I do not see a mid- or long-term role for Doug Wood on the continent. He only speaks English and currently has little feel for the continent - which is neither American nor Britain. English only players will ALWAYS fall behind locals. In every country where we need to have an impact, the impact MUST be in local language and should be with a local national. GRA work is political (i.e., irrational and emotional). Brits are Europeans and Americans are people too doesn't wash with local politicians. The fact that some locals are willing to speak English is a trick. The real business - particularly regulatory and political business - is always done in local language. Local GRA people, local country managers, local lawyers, etc. are not going to suffer an English only player gladly. Let's be realistic about this. Doug Wood has no future on the continent. 5) Research Specialists (and other such creatures): We should not have such creatures. That is a go nowhere job and it attracts go nowhere people. More seriously, it would be a fantastic place for a direct out of the university eager Analyst to get an introduction to Enron before hitting a commercial desk. That will also help ensure that future commercial teams will better understand the role of GRA. The continuity argument doesn't wash. Many commercial Analyst and Associates rotate leaving continuity problems behind. I am getting rid of my personal Research Specialist and will farm the work out in the future to rotating Analysts (watch out Gregor and Eric). Reg Affairs should get rid of all of their Research Positions. We must ensure that enough first rotation Analysts are assigned to this task. I have several times in several different countries seen Analyst level work outsourced to very highly paid consultants simply because GRA didn't have any resource. Besides being expensive and wasteful, this costs a would be Analyst a great learning experience. Perhaps each commercial country manager and each country specific GRA person should share a research analyst as a first round rotator. All of our senior relationship work, etc. would be done much more professionally if that were the case and our consulting bills would fall. 6) Country Managers: Each country manager (such as Radmacher, Renggli, a hopefully soon to be new Italian one, etc.) should be spending a meaningful (ca. 10 to 15%) of their time on GRA activities. The commercial country manager should by definition have the best feel in Enron for what we need to do how and with whom in his/her country. They must be told that GRA leadership - together with you and the gas and power leadership executives - is part of their job. A new market manager such as the future Italian country manager should consider GRA leadership an essential part of getting their market off of the ground. Any commercial country manager who wants to 100% outsource GRA leadership in his/her country should be replaced. Further, this should also reduce the need for too many VP and Sr Director level GRA people at this time. 7) Italy: A Spaniard that speaks Italian is a good SHORT-term solution for Italy. If we successfully hire a new Italian country manager, he should get heavily involved in this initially. Eventually, we will need a real-live Italian in Italy but we probably don't need to look for him/her this quarter. 8) Local Politics, Local Language, Local National: Should apply to: Germany, The Netherlands, Austria/Switzerland (perhaps together, but then done by a German), France(&, perhaps Belgium), Spain, Italy. I cannot imagine that we need any resource in former Communist Europe - Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, etc. I have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions; but, I am going to make this my final and conclusive list of GRA suggestions. I look forward to working with you in this regard. Already have engagements in the GRA space in Switzerland and Germany this year and am sure that there are many to come. Congratulations in you new role and best of wishes. JT\nAnswer: sensitive"

What we specifically discussed, and what scott s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates. We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals. I think the confusion is in what the term validation means. In the ENA context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).

In addition, even when the curve validation process is fully up and running, we should continue looking at major position impacts in new transactions. There are many curves to review. It seems reasonable to look at the critical rate curves as appropriate. Let me know. Jim Steffes\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I think that we should argue that the following package of information be pre-assembled and provided to Govt Affairs when EES brings a deal to RAC: 1. List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 2. Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in the deal. Not just the \"scalars\" but also the absolute $/Mwh. 3. For each impacted position, the key assumptions contained within the curves - a. deregulation date (if any) b. stranded cost roll-off date (if any) c. standard offer end date (if any) d. other rate reduction dates and amounts (if any) 4. Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal (for example, movement in pricing terms given some event) I also think that we should have at least 3 working days to review this package. If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis, I would be game. Thanks. JDS\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO. In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities. My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going. If we have specifically committed to certain things, then let's follow through. If there are things we can avoid, let's avoid them. Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel. With respect to the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions? These are the kinds of things we need to consider.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at this stage) you need to know the following. The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session. As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight. Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request. Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services. She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you. We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward. We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people. This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner. Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting. The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future. I had planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us. Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point. These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision. Joe\nAnswer: sensitive"

I intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever I can, but we need help immediately on the regulatory front - the last thing I would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the governmental approval stage- being proactive now by bringing Jose over the wall would be my strong recommendation.Please advise.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Wholesale Curve Validation The existing process incorporates validation of all wholesale curves and includes monthly validations and random curve reviews. Every month, results of the validation are summarized in a memo and distributed to the Senior Management. Results of the random curve reviews are brought up to the attention of Desk Heads responsible for the respective curves and Senior Management as necessary. Curve Assessment Green: - curve is reasonable - small P&L impact from curve shift Yellow: - curve is illiquid - medium-to-large position and P&L impact from curve shift - some ability to validate prices from external sources Red: - curve mark is inaccurate (based on external data obtained) - curve is illiquid: no ability to validate externally - significant positions and P&L impact from curve shift Curves that are inaccurately marked based on data obtained from external sources are urged by the Senior Management to be corrected. In the cases where external data is not available or clear, the Senior Management urges the respective Desk Head not to increase an already large illiquid position or to built in a risk premium by widening the respective bid/offer spread and not to take on positions inside of that spread. Selection CriteriaThe criteria for monthly curve selection are the following: P&L sensitivity Largest positions Staleness (curves have not been marked for a period of time) Completeness (curves that have not been validated in a long time) The main criteria for random curve validation is new deals. Curve Validation ToolsBroker Quotes/Other external dataGraph Analysis (curve slope vs. a peer group, curve humps/sculpting vs. a peer group, curve shift vs. position shift, etc.)New Deal Analysis (comparison of curve marks and executed/quoted prices)Boundary Analysis/V@R Simulations (comparison of curve to simulated curve boundaries using Enron's V@R Engine)SAVA Model Comparison (comparison of curves to model generated results) Tariff Curve Validation Scope/Timing:ASAP - 20 curves with the largest positions related to deals pending review: (Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, Starwood) - to ensure timely and smooth approval of these deals.Next 30-days - 20 curves with the largest positions/P&L impactMonthly/Quarterly - 20 curves selected based on criteria described aboveRandomly - curves with significant positions/P&L impact, resulting from new deals Data Gathering: This Month: Listing of 20 curves (related to deals in progress) and the related support requested by EGA (to be provided by Scott Stoness)On-going Basis: The process of obtaining data should be streamlined and the curve validation process should be relatively painless: - RAC should have access to the curve data (Minal Dalia is fully devoted to EES and is currently residing on the EES floor) - Curve assumptions should be documented (to be provided by Scott Stoness) Execution/Reporting: RAC, EGA and EES Risk Management Group work together on curve validation utilizing available tools and work on developing new tools Utilize the Wholesale Curve Assessment methodology (Green, Yellow, Red) Generate a curve validation report (see template attached)Provide feedback to the Desk Heads and distribute the Curve Validation Report to Enron and EES Senior Management Other Curves Other curves related to EES business should be gradually incorporated into the aforesaid process (ancillary services, congestion, DSM and labor related curves) - let us set a timetable. In conclusion, curve validation results should be evaluated in conjunction with other risk analytics: stress testing of prices, volatilities and correlations, Value-at-Risk/Capital-at-Risk analysis, performance measures, capital allocation framework, etc. Vlady.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity NeedsDan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif. ( October 17, 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate \"power emergencies\" because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors emissions. \"We are seeing a lot of under-generation,\" McCullough said. \"This is market power in action.\" Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies, including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. \"That can't possibly be right,\" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. \"In North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). \"Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, I can't comment,\" Lloyd said. \"We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,\" he said. \"We don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high.\" Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states, British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. \"EPA data is notoriously unreliable,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. \"Greed would get the best of anybody,\" Wolak said. \"I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out.\" Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading companies. \"If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,\" Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled \"proprietary\" by companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets. \"Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally?\" Belden said. \"California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody understands,\" he said. \"If you've got nothing to hide, release the data.\" ----- To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com (c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

George W. Bush wants to compare notes on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to closing the so-called ``digital divide'' that sometimes leaves minority households behind in the computer age during a planned Wednesday meeting with technology leaders. About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member high-tech council, including Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were scheduled to meet behind closed doors at Austin's Jewish Community Center.?. . ``I am excited about all of the opportunities that technology has given us to make a profound and positive impact on the world,'' said Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. ``America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is vital for us to maintain this status,'' Bush said. '' Leading the world in innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create many quality jobs.'' The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to present Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew. The campaign also was to unveil its revamped Web site. One of its features will allow users to download event-specific posters or placards for campaign events. - USATodayAd-Bush NSC.pdf\nAnswer: sensitive"

A stock sale generally avoids these issues. If the Enron then plans to \"sell\" it's direct shares in the JV, then there is, I believe a \"Fair Trading Commission\" notification that is required. Your word, \"proforma\" probably describes the nature of FTC approval here. However, this may not be an insignificant matter if a \"buyer\" such as Tractable or Samchully were involved the FTC might be \"active\" in it review of the transaction because of concerns about the Seoul Metropolitan area. I still believe Enron's biggest challenge related to dealing the JV shares directly, is the \"honeymoon\" clause in the \"Shareholders' Agreement\" between ourselves and SK Corp. Darrell Kinder commented to me recently that he did not feel that the \"monetization\" process that was being developed would suffer as a result of this clause - he said he couldn't see on what basis SK would object. A transaction that involves another true \"industry\" buyer, however, may be a very hard sell to SK. Regardless of the nature of the buyer (financial institution or energy sector operator), SK is likely and legitimately bargain hard. Enron, considering they have always maintained that a partnership with Enron was one of their objectives for organizing the JV with us. It is said that our price was not the highest one but SK's Chairman Chey \"broke the tie\" based on his reception in Houston in October of 1988. Hence, SK might now oppose strongly to protect itself. If Enron should sell the shares of Enron, Korea LLC rather than the underlying shares in SKE, then it may be subject to some notices in the US (check) but may avoid the kOREAN issues. But it may avoid the \"honeymoon\" period approval by SK Corp. (Legal/Tax questions for the most part). The \"change of control\" issue that I briefly mentioned is relates to any language that triggers the \"honeymoon\" provisions based on the \"ultimate\" parent being some entity other than Enron. If such language is lurking somewhere in the document. then all roads would seem to lead back to having SK Corp's blessing. Hope this is clear as jet lag has grabbed my brain this evening.

J. Rudden about Steve Garwood's statements concerning the large RTOs jeopardizing reliability. His statement was really amateurish. Rudden's web page ( www.rjrudden.com) <http://www.rjrudden.com)> includes a list of clients, including the following that should be concerned: Calpine, Enron, ISO NE, Midwest ISO, NY ISO, PJM, Southern Energy, and U.S. Gen. Concerning Christi's question on whether we need a computer group looking at the question of redundancy of systems, I don't think we need it at this point. It is a given that a complete backup system for all commercial aspects of the systems will be required, along with a handoff protocol for emergency control over all transmission operational aspects of the systems. The specifics of these need to be decided when the hierarchy of each RTO is determined.\nAnswer: sensitive"

NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning. They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position. In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices. They are in a shopping mall. How secure is that? Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open. Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers. Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit. You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure. Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous. That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail. And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter. I echo Dave's question - do we want to \"call\" NERC on this issue? It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on. Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud. (By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of \"NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards\"? Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle. Next they'll say that the 60 in \"2600\" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)\nAnswer: sensitive"

The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's \" Four RTO policy\" set forth in its July 12th Order. The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB. Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations. Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 \"the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.\" They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much. This event was attributed to the so-called \"NIMBA virus\". NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to \"reliability standards.\" They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order. Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised. It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting. However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.\nAnswer: sensitive"

The RED Index, which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by22 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets, todayreleased the U.S. rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia,in a 187 page report. Key results included: 1. Pennsylvania 66 2. Texas 65 3. New York 64 4. Maine 62 17. California 34 \"These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation onwhich electric competition can grow,\" said Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center. \"While California's crisis has brought a lot of positive attention toPennsylvania's model, many customers in the Keystone State are returning totheir original utility suppliers. It underscores how important it is to putthe right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefitover the long haul,\" Malloy said. In rankings that included all of North America, the province of Albertaactually would rank above all the states with a score of 68. The mid-year RED Index also found that 62% of states expressing an opinionindicated that their commission is not \"less likely to take action on energyrestructuring as a result of the California crisis.\" CAEM is an independent, nonprofit, think tank based in Washington, DC whosemission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to thecompetitive model of regulation.

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job. Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc, through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly. Equally as important, the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger). Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC. I hope this \"pleads our case\" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.

CLHB has reinitated LPG operations to LaPaz, but continue their inspection. TR will not reinitiate gas or crude export operations until we have completed our inspection. We have formed joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection. It could take as long as 48 hours, but we'll have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning. All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system, but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano. The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down, bled off, and locked. Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert. Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and inspection action plan. We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE (the regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz - this should cover LaPaz's electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection. The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz. We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in). We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system. We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz. Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed with the message. We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days. In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary. The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action. Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we're still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, or if it is against government. Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow. Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold. The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void. We're watching this situation closely. The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational situation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

Our OSSA II (crude exports to Chile) and GAA (gas to LaPaz) share the same ROW, and would likely have been taken out with the bomb. We understand that the bomb, which had a manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode. The Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediate threat neutralized. However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and will notify the Enron Crisis team. We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network. The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply. I've notified all relevant government authorities of the situation, and so far am getting support. I've also asked the Embassy to look into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful. Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible. Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano, we will continue operations, with all stations on alert. We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon as our people complete the overall plan. I will keep you posted as things develop. Steve\nAnswer: sensitive"

The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill. There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.

In short, a very bad bill.Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day. Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes). What people don't know:Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time. Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley. Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort. Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded efforts. What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy. Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time. Thanks. Mike\nAnswer: not sensitive"

They went to 1st Union. I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will not be affected. I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement.

My understanding from the India CFO (in response to my query about approvals necessary for any sell-down like we are working on for Dabhol) is that it depends to whom we sell. If we sell to an Indian company, then the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) must approve taking dollars out of India. If a sale is made outside India, no Indian approvals are necessary. There are, however, many other approvals that would need to be obtained -- specifically from lenders and counterparties pursuant to project documents. I have not analyzed these financial-related approvals.\nAnswer: sensitive\n\nQuestion: I am working on a"

California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.

My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel. Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize. Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering. These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process. I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US. We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses. Thanks! John Sherriff (Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports) We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises. In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending. In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect: Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include: all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details. John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered. Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved. So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel. Please communicate this policy to your staff. Michael Brown\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The order provides for $69 million in \"potential\" refunds (either pay up or provide cost justification). Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was ($3.18 million). It's not over yet, though. The order deals only with Jan 01 and promises further orders regarding Dec 00 and benchmark prices through April 01. The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 16000). With respect to sales to California, we have concluded at least one short term sale and have talked with Cal Dept of Water Resources about longer term deals, but we were still struggling with credit issues, last I heard. I'm copying Jeff Dasovich because I'm sure he has more up to date information.\nAnswer: sensitive"

We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting. Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases. California is pursuing the latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements. In the short term, we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases. I am attaching text I have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Specifically I think we should determine a fair market value for the PR we received from the event overall and I would like to transfer pay that amount from Corp to EBS. I know that sounds a little agressive but if you think about it the analysts are very focused on EBS's streaming revenue, which has been tough to come by. Also it really is a net zero dollar amount to Enron at the end of the day but hopefully value creating to the stock price. Hope this is not a problem. ----- Forwarded by Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications on 07/14/00 04:22 PM -----\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I have summarized the main visibility we received. There were several more \"freebies\" in the end, but they are not accounted for in the following: We had a total of 40 thirty-second commercials that ran on NBC and TNT (the Turner Network). We also had 8-10 billboards which said \"This portion of Wimbledon was brought to you by Enron, a leading energy and broadband services company.\" The broadcaster who announced the match also gave us plugs by saying, \"Watch this on the net at www.wimbledon.net, streamed by Enron.\" There was a banner floating across the bottom of the page saying that as well. Additionally we received ad time and billboards on ESPN, CNNsi and several other networks. We had banners streaming on up to 10 websites, including www.msnbc.com, www.cnnsi.com and www.wimbledon.net. There was also a static banner on the Wimbledon Channel, no matter which site you watched it on (Wimbledon, CNNsi or MSNBC). All the banners took you to a jump page we created, located at www.enron.net/wimbledon. At Wimbledon we had 12 courtside seats and 24 grounds passes. I was also told that we had a small paid contract with FastTV.com to stream the archived site. We released a press release on our services with IBM, IMG, TWII and Wimbledon several days into the event; and EBS sent out an email to top clients/potential clients directing them to the site. Business Week is also releasing a profile on Enron in their upcoming eBiz section, which features the Wimbledon Club as a customer. Please let me know if you have any questions I can answer. Have a great day, Margaret\nAnswer: sensitive"

I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be a serious mistake. Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation. I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora. I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it. If it gets through committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route. I look forward to the discussion.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

However, given Jeff Brown's efforts, the political need for inoculation and other political developments, it is timely to once again discuss Enron's position.

The discussioncovered the chances of stand-alone reliability legislation. Where do you stand on this issue? As you are aware, ELCON has been opposed to any kind of stand-alonelegislation -- including reliability. At first, we were not stronglyopposed to the stand-alone reliability piece. However, we have become moreopposed as time has passed and we have seen how the vertically-integratedrecalcitrant utilities have been able dominate NERC and stifle anyprogressive market-oriented movement. We think things would be as bad --if not worse -- with the stand-alone creation of NAERO. The establishmentof NAERO -- alone -- would not be good for the development of markets. Given this, we are concerned about how things are going. However, wearen't doing much on our own since we would be very ineffective. We areopen to ideas. John\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Our amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies. The BLM made a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate, but we had reached key Senators and staff and they got nowhere. Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House Conference members. Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the key Republicans in the House. We've already recruited the important Democrats. Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him. We trust he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg, formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even meeting to discuss the issue. We continue, though, on several other fronts: 1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and Congressmen writing BLM and USFS2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest Service have not gotten the message. Our position is that we'll be satisfied that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood EBS build is retracted.3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the longer-term issue next session. We have no trouble finding champtions eager to own the issue4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 companies and associations now actively engaged. Enron chairs this initiative, with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and stature as a serious communications player.6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from the end-user perspective BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused. We don't think they've given up though, and it's likely an issue of pride at this point. So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the full court press.

It is looking positive that he may be positioned to make the announcement Monday. However, DOE will likely need to revisit some folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet like APX, Altra, and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.) Too, I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel as a model since their timeline was slow, but rather suggest the TVA Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only four meetings. I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week. I have also discussed this with John Anderson of ELCON who is supportive.\nAnswer: sensitive\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Jeff:"

Bob appeared comfortable with establishing a \"Blue Ribbon\" panel, similar to the reliability panel, to address this issue. In fact, Bob suggested that the reliability panel, which includes a balance of key stakeholders, could be re-tasked with this issue. We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure (governance, segments, executive committees) and scope of the organization (retail, wholesale, gas, electric). Bob plans to follow-up with us next week. Jeff\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.

I work with Polly Traylor whosuggested that I contact you for help. I'd like to talk to someone at Enron for a story I'm doingfor the Standard on Internet CEOs, including CEOs or presidents who've led traditional companiesinto successful Internet ventures. I first need to identify who at Enron that person would be, i.e.,who's most responsible for the success of the company's Internet ventures: Jeffrey Skilling (he gotthe most ink in BusinessWeek's story in this issue), Kenneth Lay, or the head of EnronOnline. Then Ineed to talk to someone who could help coordinate a phone interview with me (I'm in Los Angeles sothis would be a phone interview). Can you give me some suggestions? Ideally, I'd love to do aninterview this week, but have some flexibility. Thanks so much in advance for any help you can give.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

First, as soon as the upper house of parliament passes legislation, Austria will have accelerated their market oppening, to 100% in power by 2001, October, and by 2002, October for gas. Sadia, you will want to reflect this in what you are doing for Kyran/EES, and Kathryn, you will want to note this, if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts. Margaret, FYI to you, too. Second, I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), saying liberalisation would bring down prices by 12-15%. Paul H., suggest you have Viviana get a copy, and if in English, send copies to Margaret Carson. Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 20GWh p.a. This goes to 10 GWh on 31 December 2002. Sadia, I think this is again an acceleration, to be reflected in your updated numbers. Margaret and Kathryn, also note. Finally, Kyran, I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is \"not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation\". I may take issue with this, depending upon what the full text says. Can you work with Teun/Sadia to obtain a copy, and, if not too lengthy, get it translated for my review (and presumably your's, too)? thanks Please do not hesitate to contact me should any of you have any questions. thanks mcs\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Long time no talk. I hope you are well - I KNOW you are busy! Ijust have a couple of matters for your attention: 1. We, as part of a group of Northwest IOUS, are exploring the possibility ofretaining former Montana Governor Racicot to work BPA issues on our behalf. PGE will continue with Mike Andrews as our lobbyist but Racicot would work forthe IOUs as a group. Does this cause you any concerns? Incidentally, we maystep up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of thesituation out here. Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinatingwhat we do with any of your folks in DC. 2. One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPAAdministrator. For a variety of reasons, there really aren't any goodcandidates from the Northwest and we're probably all to close to the situationanyway. I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideasfor someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest? Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration? 3. With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra, we would very much like theability to use Enron Online for trading. I believe we can get the regulatoryapprovals necessary but apparently when we raised this some months ago, therewas strong opposition from within Enron, particularly Joe Hartsoe. Do you seean issue with pursuing this? How do you suggest I move this forward? Thanks, Steve. As you may hear from time to time, things are going well herein Oregon. We are proceeding on our restructuring, which is beginning to getnotice from NARUC and others as a possible model for states that have not yetproceeded. It's an interesting world. I look forward to hearing from you.\nAnswer: The text is from a work email and may contain"

Also, we have not focused much recently on the transmission pricing issues. This may be an opportunity to discuss this in context.

In his oral testimony, Franklin kept ephasizing the lack of FERC cost/benefit studies on RTOs and the similar (alleged) lack of studies and analysis to support the 4 RTO model.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Under Steve Hopper's leadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday. During the crisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael Megarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached). At the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the site, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image. I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in response to stakeholder concerns. The Plan was updated daily by the Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every meeting/conference call. The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement the Operations Report. I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early stages of the crisis. It was extremely helpful. Regards, Keith\nAnswer: sensitive"

It was ourintention from the onset of this program to have our funds go to thisaccount. The various points of contact from the RNC caused some minorconfusion so checks went to Texas instead of DC.

I think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this. There may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use: On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS Phase II (the new OASIS proposal). In particular, FERC states that this new OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs). FERC says that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc. FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.) This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked out after the first denial for lack of ATC.) FERC also wants information on whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that should be standardized.Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is available today. (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC has not adopted that idea yet.)Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be very likely to be adopted (with some changes). I think it is better to be in on the front end. Enron's participation would also give validity to their system.Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more \"classes\" for his staff from Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky told Dan L. that \"AEP has nothing to hide.\" This type of venture would allow AEP one venue to make good on that statement.Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system. This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

You may wish to 'top and tail' this. Enron continues to expand aggressively in Europe. Forty Grosvenor Place, our European Headquarters, continues to accommodate this expansion, but the long lead times involved in obtaining premises in London require us to evaluate the future accommodation requirements of the business now. We are considering a number of scenarios, and have reviewed all currently available sites within a 25 mile radius of Central London. Ideally we would be looking to accommodate all Enron employees in one building, and we require significant swing capacity to expand or contract the space available depending on our business requirements. One of the options currently available is a site being developed by Canary Wharf in London's Docklands. We have been looking to secure an option on this site so that we may properly evaluate the opportunity and consult with our employees. On Friday 21 July we agreed non-binding Heads of Terms with Canary Wharf for the letting of 1.5m sq. ft. This was a prerequisite to obtaining exclusivity whereby we have until 30 September to negotiate contractual terms or walk away from the deal. We will continue to evaluate other options, and there is clearly no commitment to conclude a deal with Canary Wharf. An announcement was made to employees at the all staff update last Thursday (attached). Media speculation has forced Canary Wharf to issue a London Stock Exchange Announcement confirming that we have agreed outline terms on a potential letting and that discussions continue.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Yesterday morning during the all-employee staff update, Fernley Dyson, on behalf of John Sherriff, provided staff with an update on the impact Enron=01,s rapid growth in Europe is having on our overall space needs at Enron House. It was acknowledged that this is an important subject and one about which many employees have a lot of questions. The message was clear. In the day to day decision-making process about Enron=01,s commercial activities, it is critical to understand what options are available and to keep as many avenues open as possible. In turn, it is equally important to take this same approach when looking at Enron=01,s future office space requirements. What is the bottom line? Looking to the future, the preference would be for all London-based employees to be housed in a single location. One of the options under consideration is Canary Wharf, but we must stress that no decision has been taken at this time. We are currently evaluating all the options available to us in the London property market. If we are to move to a new building, it will not occur before 2003. We will be seeking input and feedback from employees as part of the decision-making process. We are committed to keeping the channels of communication open and to provide information to employees on a timely basis.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The purpose of the meeting is to try to get the FERC, CAISO, DWR and other market participants to work out issues related to reliability that have arisen in recent months. Issues include those that that affect operations and reliability such as the must-offer requirements, ramping, etc. He was not clear as to whether they would address creditworthiness issues. From the FERC staff \"non-decisional\" employees will attend. He invited solutions/proposals in advance of the meeting. Enron needs to decide who to send. Alan Comnes\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Best,Jeff**********************************************************************FinancialCalifornia Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy TalksPeter Behr 07/06/2001The Washington PostFINALPage E01Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt torecover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , sayingthey may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate$43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed thisyear. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state isseeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-termcontracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment forDavis. \"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people couldget us $8.9 billion,\" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a reportyesterday. \"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money.However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.\" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over aCalifornia settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sourcesclose to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today onthe amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannotreach a compromise. \"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,\" Wagner toldreporters. \"In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point Imay offer a preliminary assessment.\" The settlement conference is set toconclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push bothsides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricingcontroversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 'slargest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury andput Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state'slights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn,chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power gridmanager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion inrefunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyersfor all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda,and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a \"joke\" that theparties might as well wear \"clown suits,\" according to a Dow Jones reportconfirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led byReliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and SouthernCo., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. Thesuppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is ableto call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds,sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC'scommissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, butnow is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 'selectricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higherrefund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part ofan overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state willhave to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failedderegulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases atvolatile \"spot market\" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer,so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff begannegotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion indeals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for amegawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over thenext 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state waspaying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- andconsiderably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade,energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve politicalpressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state'scontroversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue thatreducing future power charges that his administration negotiated shouldcount as a \"refund\" because the deals were reached \"under commercialduress,\" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.\"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,\" saidMichael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a \"just and reasonable\"standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit,the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. \"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,\"said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversightcommittee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room\"billions of dollars apart,\" as the talks approached their final weekend,sources said.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

As you may recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions. MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint \"warrants expeditious action.\" As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority through 11/15/00. That order stated that the ISO \"maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay.\" The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could \"choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets.\" FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, \"To the extent permitted by law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.\" The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, \"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.\" MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the price cap reduction. FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum purchase price be reinstated. The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price they want. Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay. \"Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot dictate their price.\" Importantly, however, FERC also states that, \"ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs.\" [Emphasis added] FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market (\"OOM\") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price. Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC states clearly that, \"such a requirement is not permitted by our November 12 Order and the ISO tariff.\" [Emphasis added] FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISO's tariff. This would require 60 days' advance notice, \"and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval. As stated above, our November 12 Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase price.\" ISO is then \"put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets.\" Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert. Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California. Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to \"straddle the fence\" and that, \"Today, the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role.\" He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps. He also suggests that, \"Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid. The record supports such a move.\" He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, stating that it, \"thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to 'command and control.' \" Hebert states that, \"The independence of the ISO's governing structure stands threatened. We should 'stand up,' to quote the resignation letter.\" Hebert advocates opening a section 206 proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets, \"including the California markets.\" This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price. This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO. Please call if you have any questions. Dan\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Although, the contract looks like it only allows us Intranet use and not Internet use as well. This premise was confirmed by Margaret too, because she recalls paying $2,000.00 for a Intranet/Internet video link, and only $500.00 for a Intranet link. My unsolicited recommendation would be to purchase the external link as well as the internal link. I believe we would get a lot of mileage out of posting this link on our website - with downloadable supporting software - to allow users to view the video. From a PR perspective, I would refer 90% of incoming inquiries to our site, as well as sending them general company info. Also, it would unequivocally illustrate and promote why Enron's has been voted 'Most Innovative Company' for five consecutive years in a row. Now...enough of my blabber and to the point...I am still waiting to hear back from CNN to assess exact pricing for both types of links. I've placed two follow-up calls but have not yet heard anything. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to inquire with me. Regards, Cindy\nAnswer: not sensitive"

As you know, Reliance and ONGC owe EOGIL approximately $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including interest on non-payment). The arbitration notices reflected only the non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for RIL and ONGC respectively. We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July 29th and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July 31, 2000. This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in other means, but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the only solution in the end. While nobody likes to file arbitration, the good news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as I can tell, at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision. If the issue gets external, I don't know how any of the parties will respond. Our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible, but this is India and I would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it. I will be in contact with John Ambler today to discuss the details of the submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be necessary. While both parties were expecting the notice, it may leak into the media over the next few days. Please defer any questions or comments to either John Ambler, Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue. Until John advises us otherwise, our comment will be as follows; \" The parties (ONGC, Reliance and Enron Oil and Gas India Limited) have had a dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party using the guidelines as set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement.\" Mike Smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with John Ambler and the appropriate staff. I will be available to respond if necessary and my contact numbers are as follows; office-713-853-5934pager 888-493-1770cell 713-569-4713home 281-320-2198 Larry, please make sure our office understands that only you are to comment on this and any other official E&P business in India and Wade/Sanjay would you share this note with the appropriate people in your office so nobody is surprised if something comes up.

Call in number is below. Duke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to California's Power Supply Shortfall Committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California And a Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING, Calif., July 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke EnergyNorth America (DENA) today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specificsolutions to address the state's electricity supply shortage proposing todeliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generationfacilities. In addition, DENA proposed a five-year, fixed-price supplycontract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatileelectricity prices. \"California's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods resultfrom insufficient supply to meet the demand,\" said Jim Donnell, president andchief executive officer of DENA. \"In the past ten years, no significant newpower generation facilities have been built in California. During the sameperiod, peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts. This combinationhas caused the state's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent, whichnecessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility.\" Under current procedures, it takes in excess of four years to deliver newpower generation in California. To add substantial incremental generatingcapacity to California, DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existingauthority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline thepermitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentallyfriendly generation by 2001. DENA also asked the governor to use his currentauthority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts withenergy providers, so they could better manage their exposure to high energyprices. To help solve the state's supply shortfall, DENA said it remainedcommitted to adding substantial generation in California. Within two monthsand upon receiving final regulatory approvals, the company will beginconstruction on 1,000 megawatts at its Moss Landing facility. The expansionof the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation bysummer 2002. And, with an expedited permitting process, DENA could deploy itsavailable resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercialoperation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002. To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experiencedthis year, DENA offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to theincumbent utilities at $50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginningSept. 1, 2000. This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for areasonable time period during which additional generation resources can bebuilt. \"DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for thecitizens of California through these proposals,\" Donnell said. \"We areconfident that our expertise in building and operating power generationfacilities can help resolve the supply crisis.\" Duke Energy North America (DENA), is a leading wholesale energy servicescompany.

The challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the benefit and effectiveness of our ads. We can measure on a periodic basis what the CEO/CCO/CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign. I understand this dilemma. But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our employees think about these ads. If all else fails these ads should make our employees proud to work for Enron - and this is something we should be able to measure on a consistent basis. I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will talk about problems and challenges we have - so if you could consider this idea I would be very appreciative. And of course don't get to hooked on God's country while you are in Napa. Thanks! John\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Are they a legal entity? Are they on our payroll? If they are we filed EEO-1's for them. Below is the criteria to file an EEO-1 report: Standard Form 100 must be filed by - A. All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments, primary and secondary school systems, institutions of higher education, Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor organizations; OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees if the company is owned or affiliated with another company, or there is centralized ownership, control or management (such as central control of personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes a single enterprise, and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more employees. B. All federal contractors (private employers), who: (1) are not exempt as provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) have 50 or more employees, and (a) are prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors, and have a contract, subcontract, or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more; or (b) serve as a depository of Government funds in any amount, or (c) is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and Notes. All multi-establishment employers, i.e. employers doing business at more than one establishment, must file: (1) a report covering the principal or headquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing 50 or more persons; (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees by race, sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees; and (4) a list, showing the name, address, total employment and major activity for each establishment employ-ing fewer than 50 persons, must accompany the consolidated report. All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package. For the purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary. The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts. Their line of thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits indirectly from the contract as well. If GSP is completely free standing and they do not participate in Enron's benefits, abide by our policies or procedures , participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be funded by Enron Corp. , etc., they may have some type of argement not to comply but I doubt it. If we own them over 51% I don't see a way they could not file EEO-1's and have an AAP. We do all the AAP's in Corporate so if this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know. Thanks!

Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier' contractor. (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him today.) Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors. Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare affirmative action plans. In addition, we do not feel that we are subject to an OFCCP audit. Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1 and AAPs. Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any of this. Hoyt\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Hi, Amy - Kelly Kimberly got this letter from a woman she knows who works at Harvard, in the Kennedy School of Government, for an initiative called Women Waging Peace. Enron is a supporter of WWP, and Joe Sutton is on their corporate cabinet. What do you think about her idea below, and Enron's involvement, if any? Please feel free to pass this along to others who you think might want to consider it, or who might be more appropriate to consider it.Thanks, Stacy x3-3583 I have an interesting idea that I wanted to share with you. Just last weekhere at the Kennedy School, I met with a woman named Susan Bird, who sitson the Women's Leadership Board of the Kennedy School. She is the Founderand President of Women.future in New York City, NY. She headed the launchof the organization (part of which was held here at KSG, the main body ofwhich was held in NYC and telecast to KSG). It was a masterfully conceivedand brilliantly orchestrated three-phase global event for businesswomen. Iimagine you heard about it. Susan told me last week that one of her current, burning interests is inhow women business leaders (corporate leadership across the private andpublic sectors) can change and influence public policy. She wants tocreate a public venue, invite women business leaders, and discuss thecentral question, \"If we assume that today's global problems require moreand more from the business world, would these problems look any differentif women business leaders/owners were involved?\" Susan and I wonder if this is something Enron (and/or potentially othercorporate sponsors) would like formally to sponsor. Furthermore, Susan'scompany could video this executive forum, streamline the video, and link itto the Women Waging Peace Website. My sense is that it's a win-win foreveryone. I told her that I would contact you and discuss the possibility. Wouldlove to hear your thoughts first, before I engage in further conversationwith Susan. If this is something in which Enron is interested, I couldeasily arrange a phone conversation among Swanee, Susan, you, and me in thenear future to discuss the idea in greater depth. I am available for a conversation about the idea anytime, and I can bereached directly at (617) 495-8330.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I think the referendum is very important for the city and will help us continue to show Houston as a significant metropolitan area. I am not convinced that the ultimate form of the deal for minority participation in Enron Field was, in fact, what was intended. In that agreement, Aramark owns all of the concessions, but has a 30% profit share with minorities. My understanding is that there are no minority owned businesses in that deal. I would like to communicate this sentiment, but I would also, certainly like to reinforce Enron's position. Thanks,Mark\nAnswer: not sensitive"

This is the same commitment thatwe received from the Rockets in 1999. We received a commitment from thesports authority and the mayor's office that the minority participation goalof 30% will be included in the contract. We have met with Celena Garza andcommunicated with Al Luna our interests and they have expressed theirsupport for our position. We have also asked Sen. Mario Gallegos for hissupport and received it. We are in the process of confirming that our language calling for such goalhas been included in the final document and that Al Luna and Celena Garzaare sufficiently satisfied with the language, which will be voted on laterthis week. Once confirmed, Sonny Flores, Chairman of the Economic Development Committeehas recommended to Massey that the Chamber be prepared to offer some sort ofpublic statement in support or not supporting a referendum to build thearena. (We have been asked to address the Construction Committee of thesports authority by Billy Burge and Wayne Smith) Sonny has indicated thatonce we have a confirmation from Al and Celena, our interests should besufficiently covered and that supporting the referendum would be good forHispanic businesses. Massey has asked that I poll the board for its input and get a majoritycommitment from the board so as to move forward in offering support or nosupport for the referendum. Ordinarily, this would be discussed andconsidered at a meeting of the Board of Directors, however, since the sportsauthority posted its meeting notice (72 hours prior to meeting) and is readyto proceed with its approval of the Letter Agreement with the HoustonRockets we are seeking input in this manner. I am attaching a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Chamberand the Sports Authority for you review. There have been no revisions tothe last copy that was circulated at the past Executive Committee meeting atTony Grijalva's office. Massey has asked that you respond with your input, suggestions and positionfor or not for the chamber offering its support for the arena via e-mailwithin 24 hours of this notice. The chamber's position will be determinedby the majority of those respondents to this e-mail by no later than 4:00p.m. CDT on Wednesday, August 2, 2000. - Sports Authority MOU, July 20, 2000.doc\nAnswer: sensitive"

The description will start with People\\ or Room\\ unless it was entered manually at the source.Data connections: One connection is being charged for each room instead of one connection for each port in a room. Attached are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services. EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC. For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose. People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service. EIS bills services on a one month lag. We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee. This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information. Please examine these billings for accuracy. If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative. If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".\nAnswer: not sensitive"

My take, after discussions with Terry, was that she was brought on to handle the environmental side of sustainable development, but that Palmisano was utilizing her for greenhouse gas related issues since not much had occurred on the other front yet. Burt Mike and I learned last week that she actually reports to Palmisano--he is the one who took her from consultant to employee status. I spoke with John on Friday and told him that I wasn't going to poach her now that I knew where she fit in the scheme of things. This actually solves a dilemma for me anyway. As you know, I need a more senior environmental person with good high level relationships with NGOs and I didn't want her to feel slighted when I found someone. Moreover, she has just advised us that she and her husband are moving to San Francisco and wants to telecommute. This should work fine for John but I feel it is important for my person to be in DC or NY.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the \"gap financing\" fund.UNEP conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are quite interested in climate change business opportunities. Also it provided a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc. Discussions with participants in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with them directly on that).

California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be. We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization. We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

See below. > http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/ A 1960 Moment Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democrats--and everyone else--something to cheer about. BY PEGGY NOONAN Monday August 7, 2000 4:26 p.m. EDT The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gore's running mate is so smart, so clever, so good, so satisfying, so striking that it just may turn this election a bit on its head for a while. Certainly its most immediate effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los Angeles, because now the Democrats, badly hit by their own form of Clinton fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their presidential candidate, have something to cheer about. They respect Joe Lieberman. They think he has a center, a moral and ethical view of the world. He is experienced and articulate. He is decent and intelligent. He is independent. The media love him. He is a regular co-star on Imus, and all of the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers, and all of the electronic pundits and anchors, know him and admire him. But that is not what is most wonderful. What is most wonderful is that he is an Orthodox Jew. What does this mean? It means a lot of people who love America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and great breakthrough has occurred. A friend, a journalist who is politically conservative and Jewish, e-mailed me to tell me he had been weeping all morning, that he'd cried when he heard the news. Another friend, a producer at a TV news show, called and told me she woke her father in California to give him the news and they both got choked up. \"This is like 1960,\" she said, and I said I know, and I got choked up. It is wonderful when America is at her most American, and breaks down another barrier and says \"What's in your heart is most important.\" If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee, and an Episcopalian, Al Gore would have been smart to pick him. He would have been an obvious choice. The only reason he would have hesitated over Mr. Lieberman is that he's Jewish. Mr. Gore decided that was just fine. I think that I have never seen Al Gore do such an elegant, intelligent and original thing. Well done, Mr. Gore. I have to tell you, this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me. I was a little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president, and I had gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Don't Elect Catholics to the Presidency. When it happened, it's hard to describe how exciting and moving and idealism-inspiring it was. It gave a lot of people a lot of joy. It opened things up more. That was a good thing. So is this. And because this is such a good thing, I hope everyone of whatever politics or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it. Everyone should be nice and not do any political bashing until . . . Friday. However, I think it's okay and maybe even helpful to note the following. Network producers are going to decide, in their bright and touchingly uninformed minds, that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be Christian conservatives. That's where they'll go for the negative sound bites. But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman. They've been arm in arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade. He was just about the only Democrat who'd give them the time of day. He was on their side. The last time I saw Mr. Lieberman was last spring, in New York, at a symposium on Hollywood and the culture. I moderated and introduced our guests--Joe Lieberman and Bill Bennett, who are close friends and co-warriors in the values battle. Lieberman and Bennett very frankly talked to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie stars about how to make television and film and music more decent, more helpful. This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr. Lieberman--as a good guy with his head screwed on right. Many conservative Christians--I think most conservative Christians--see all of those who love God as part of the same \"cultural minority.\" Conservative Christians don't feel they have much in common, in terms of their political desires, with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and such. But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews. They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative gathering; they crowd around Dennis Prager, Michael Medved, David Horowitz and scores of others. One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians is an Orthodox Jew called Dr. Laura; the last time I saw her she was wowing them at a born-again Christian assembly at the National Prayer Breakfast last February. A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that there's \"no upside\" to the Lieberman choice. I told him there's no downside. He was surprised and said, \"He can't even campaign on Saturdays!\" I said so what, America would love to see a politician who actually put God first one day a week. I wish I'd added this: Remember Sandy Koufax? Joe Lieberman not campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur. There were a lot of great sports moments in the 1950s and 1960s, but none greater than the day in 1965 when Mr. Koufax put God before the World Series. What a great guy, what a lesson for a generation of Christian and Jewish kids. And Muslims and everyone else too. Yes, it's good news for Hillary. It's great news for Hillary. It enlivens part of her New York base, it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are the party that did this great thing, it excites people--and may help them forget, or at least not remember so vividly, that the Democratic senatorial candidate has, shall we say, a not fully satisfying relationship with New York's Jews. A historic choice like the Mr. Lieberman can overwhelm a lot of previous bad static. But let's not care about that for now. The headline is not \"Is It Good for Hillary?\" The headline is: \"It Is Good for America.\" It is a wonderful country that does something like this, that takes a good man who is a member of a small ethnic/religious minority to be one of its two major vice presidential candidates, and that greets that choice with resounding hurrahs. This is really a great day. We should all be happy. We really are a maturing democracy.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

In some cases such payments may still be legal. But, subject to Jane confirming that I am explaining this correctly (given that the communication below is a bit cryptic), it now seems to me to be timely (as Rebecca and Jim have apparently been alerted in London on Monday, per her note below) to satisfy yourself that we are now clean on this issue under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The informal customs advice was obtained by Muktesh Tyagi (spelling?), one of two people known as Sanjay's \"fixers\" (that should make you fell comfortable!). You may wish to discuss with Jane further, but once you satisfy yourself that there is some smoke here, my thought was that you might want to simply confirm with Rebecca that we are running the facts to ground, so that we can satisfy ourselves that we are either clean, or need to come clean with USG. let me know if you need more. thanks mcs ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 07/03/2001 09:42 ---------------------------\nAnswer: sensitive"

SPM (This equipment has already been imported at 22.38%, but customs is claiming merit duty rates of 67%.) This is currently being evaluated by the courts. Total Value at Risk = $7 MM2. \"D\" - Stream Are Bechtel's design charges of $66 MM specific to our equipment or to the project as a whole? If the former, then duty of 22.38% should apply. Total Value at Risk = $13.5 MM ($66 MM x 22.38%) PHASE II ISSUES1. Services Loading on Power Plant Equipment Same issue as for LNG Equipment. Currently we are paying a 10% loading on duty into a reserve deposit to cover this. Total Value at Risk = $22.38 MM ($100 MM x 22.38%)2. LNG Equipment to be dutied at 53.8% or 22.38%? Think we all know this issue. Total Value at Risk = $56 MM (as per Risk Matrix)3. Services Loading on LNG Equipment Think we all know this issue Total Value at Risk = $80 MM ($149 MM x 53.8%) TOTAL VALUE at RISK ~$180 MM - - This is WORST, WORST CASE! Note: There is still this issue of goods being imported under the wrong classification. Currently, this is preventing goods from being imported on time, which could lead to delay claims by the contractors. It will take me some time to hunt down what this could cost us if the problem isn't resolved soon. Pavan's estimate is that it will take a month for Site to generate accurate equipment lists and for the same to be reviewed and approved by MSEB.Heidi\nAnswer: sensitive"

On another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken, I was asking Justin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was any law (India or English) requiring insurers to disclose information regarding risk to the insured, so we could cite some law perhaps to compel Beachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report. For example, the Texas insurance code has evolved from a vague \"duty of good faith & fair dealing\" standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing certain things detrimental to the insured. Justin tells me English law, in this regard, consists only of precedential case law, but it still could be helpful. Because of the commercial risk (outside the ambit of arbitration in the instance) it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United India from withholding this information which is critical to running these machines. If, in fact, there truly is a 50% chance of failure in these machines, yet they won't share that evidence with us, this is a commercial risk DPC can't afford, regardless of coverage and apart from the arbitration. (I'm wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today). Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction, United India did us the favor of bringing suit in London Commercial Court earlier, and thus having availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirst's emphatic witness statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction, I think it is worth considering if they continue to refuse to give us the report in response to Justin's latest correspondence. I don't think we can afford to sit on our hands on this one. Why don't you and Neil kick this around, (since you don't have enough to do already).Cheers,Michelle\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The position on the insurance is that it does not specify a governing law.On an application of English private international law (ie conflict of lawsrules) there is uncertainty whether it would be English or Indian law. Atpara 42 of Hirst's statement, he says that the contracts are impliedlysubject to English law (based on London as the arbitration forum?).Certainly, my preference in terms of certainty would be English law.However, it is possible there could be an advantage to Indian substantivelaw and once we get UI's statement of claim, we should give thought towhether it would be worthwhile getting Indian law input on whether therecould be advantage in arguing Indian law. I will ask Diane to add this tothe \"to do\" list! Justin\nAnswer: sensitive"

Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity. That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this \"study\" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it. I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose: to influence the policy decision currently under debate \"To de-regulate or not.\" As such, I wouldn't see issues like \"PJM or APX\" or \"competitive default supplier or not,\" or \"divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets\" being the focus. That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in \"Round 2,\" once the initial debate over \"deregulate or not\" is won. To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, \"right\" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably. And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment. In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot. Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on \"how to do it,\" but that would not be the emphasis. In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of \"to deregulate or not,\" and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study. I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the \"go/no go\" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue.

Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back. I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group. It's attached. Please take a look. I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read. Few points worth mentioning: The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron. List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ.The list also includes Hogan and Joskow and Borenstein. We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis. However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., \"de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work.\" Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the \"authors\" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course. The analysis would not be a debate over \"To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc.\" In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a \"Nixon goes to China\" scenario. Please take a look at the list of participants. Again, we can add to and subtract from the list.Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.)None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum. It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan).The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project. This is for two reasons: 1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study.If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project. Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile. Appreciate your comments.

More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions. On the policy side, we are working the issue on both a state and federal level. Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda Breathitt. Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC. We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country. THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire. In the current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona). I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.

Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation). As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it recessed. The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions (Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking). The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July. However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support. More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year. What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation. Lee Sachs message was just that. I told Lee that we shared his desire to move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all non-agriculture commodities (including metals). He said that we would have a difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said \"we would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language\" (which includes favourable language on energy and metals). This is a positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues. However, I do not expect Treasury to be vocal in support of our position. It is clear that Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment. However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm to engage. A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences. Gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron. Let me know your thoughts on this approach.

Overall message: the market is working, regulation is not. In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%. But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth. The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation. The problem is regulation, not deregulation. When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH). After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers. Again, the market responded where regulation failed. San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market). In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation. Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes. Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999. Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds. The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation. Policy makers should: Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed. Expedite interconnection of new generation. Expedite siting of new facilities. Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side solutions. Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Without structural incentives to go short into real time, I would expect the CAISO to \"inc\" in some hours and \"dec\" in others -- with no consistent patterns.The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power: PX Block Forward, PX Day Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post. They had ample opportunity to purchase lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough. That left them short in the Day Ahead. They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some of their load to the Ex Post market. Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.The ISO remains primarily in \"inc\" mode even during the shoulder months when prices are lower, another indicator that the real time \"inc\" problem is driven by the load side rather than the supply side. The IOU's continue to go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market. Does it matter that the price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?The NOx market in California is very tight. How has this contributed to higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any generators from running?How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side? The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest. (I have a theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the west from an economic perspective. I can go into more detail if you wish.)Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets. For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of the state are higher? Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 8/11 and 8/12. There was congestion from California TO the northwest those days in the Day Ahead market. In real time the NW ended up being a net seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is \"workably competitive\" then there is no need for price caps. Is large-scale economic demand response required for a competitive market? What if demand response is there, but at very high prices? The demand response in California is a joke. With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only get around 600 MW of economic demand response. Much of this response comes at $1500/MWh. The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic grounds. So why this assymetric treatment? This gets to the question of the fine line between \"scarcity rents\" which are ok, and market power which is not. If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then shouldn't that be the price. At what price would the rest of the interuptible load economically curtail? Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not to or values power at more than $1500/MWh.Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market power? The reports published to date have been unimpressive. The Market Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then concludes that there is market power. But they never explain why. I would think that proof might be something like this: Generator X sets price y% of the time when loads exceed Z MWs. Or, four generators set price 80% of the time when prices exceed $200/MWh. They have all the data to be able to tell, yet they don't provide any empirical measures. The only test I've heard of so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators are submitting bids above their marginal cost. The PX report states that supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year. They fail to mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to last.\nAnswer: The text is from a work email and may contain"

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; I'm sure there are more. 1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead market? 2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 2000? How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities in 2000? 3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than in 1999?4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during Summer 2000?5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work? Why didn't more load participate? 6. What options did SDG&E have to \"hedge\" its retail rates? What were prices in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during Summer 2000?8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps? Is this appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on \"unworkably competitive\" CA ISO markets? Can these be fixed \"quickly\"? Please add other questions. Jim\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

The conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. . solutions which have become available only recently. Why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization. I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on. I am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements. I am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at Enron.\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

A list of those who have been interviewed or have been part of a focus group on this subject. The input from individuals on this list will be the basis for developing the 5-7 key scenarios that will be a part of the training. Please let me know if you feel we should include more people from your unit to insure that your unit's unique circumstances are appropriately taken into account. If so, let us know either their names or how you would like them to be identified. Some of the individuals on this list will be contacted as Subject Matter Experts to help provide real Enron contexts for the scenarios as they are further developed. 2. A list of the \"first draft\" objectives for the program and 10 possible scenarios. Since we will only be able to have a total of about 5-7 scenarios in the final version, identify the 5 - 7 on this list of high level scenario ideas that will have the most impact on improving communications and the most applicability to a range of managers across the Enron organization. Any other feedback you can provide on the objectives or scenarios would be greatly appreciated. We are seeking to move forward with the development of scenarios by the beginning of next week. Therefore, if you could provide your feedback on both of the items above by Friday, August 18th, it would be greatly appreciated. Dick Amabile\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues. It also needs to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local power pool rules. There is a similar program being prepared in London. A meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further. Mark Haedicke\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Liberalisation of Italy's Energy Markets' promises to be vital for anyone affiliated with Italian Energy and will be covering key topics in response to the recent deregulation of the electricity and natural gas markets in Italy. The main issues to be discussed include: * From state monopoly to open market: the state role in the new market * Opportunities for international companies in the deregulated gas markets * European Union directives and cross-border regulations * The changing gas market: supply and demand * Convergence of gas and power (Please see the attached programme and priority booking form for more information). If for some reason you are unable to attend, I'd be extremely grateful if you could forward this on to anyone at Enron who you feel may find this of interest. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future and sincerely hope that your company will be participating in some shape or form. In the meantime, please put 23rd/24th October in your diary and if you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to call me on +44 (0)20 7704 6521.

Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. because it holds a current power marketing certificate is an entity which we would like to move to being a direct subsidiary of Enron Corp. to take effect today. This is considered to be an essential part of restructuring to meet our current and future needs. While the day to day control will remain where it is and all the efforts assign contracts and other work should progress as planned, since the value to Enron Corp. is the power marketing certificate nothing should be done to jeopardize this. In addition we will be changing the charter and will need copies of the existing charter to effect those changes required. Please call me if you need to discuss this further.

Although Andy did not focus on it in his report, there was an individual who sat on the panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy. His name is Bill Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri. In his comments he stated that his utility was \"wholeheartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO\" and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams issues if FERC doesn't stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs. He stated that \"flexible\" standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some utility or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or different, then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for an exemption, not the other way around. I'm thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committee hearing if you have the opportunity to suggest folks to testify in the future. IF you are able to get transcripts from RTO week, it might also be worth it to review his comments and pass them on as appropriate.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company. General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the afternoon). FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions. There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go. Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward. There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future. On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission. Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical. The first major topic was \"How many RTOs? What is their scope?\" All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language. N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement. The next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\" Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent. Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation. The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward. They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you need us to provide?\" General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas. Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.\" Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation. One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design. Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry. The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions: Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient? Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated? Transmission Service - Are transmission services required to schedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are allowed)? Loop Flows - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate? If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed? Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts? Are there other solutions? Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all? Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways? Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)? Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy? Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world? Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO? Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity? Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financial hedging instruments\") will take only months. The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed. Now for a funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest. Kormos flat out said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.\" He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false. NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization. Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?\" Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations. Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization. Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history. Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?). GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell. Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man. He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag. If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions. We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction. There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done. There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB. The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward. NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position. In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top. Let me know if you have any questions.\nAnswer: sensitive"

This article is forwarded to you per Mark Palmer's request... BusinessEnron Plays The Pipes This old-time gas company is trading fuel for a future as a new-economysuperpower. Will the swap work?Frank Gibney Jr./Houston 08/28/2000Time MagazineTime Inc.38+(Copyright 2000) It's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee forlast week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 500movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's right, video on demand (not thefrustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone with a DSL line at home. What's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy company called Enron. At a time whenso many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and technology of the digital age,Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most innovative large company in America.For years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed natural gas. Then, as energyderegulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered it could make billions by trading andbrokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron is moving into thetelecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a floor bulging with Sunsupercomputers. In fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since moving its trading operations fromthe phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to more than $30 billion. Most of thatis made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk derivatives and now bandwidth--more than800 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby Gap pajamas, the company trades$600,000 blocks of natural gas--and pockets commensurately huge commissions. Boasts Enron president JeffreySkilling: \"In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online site by a factor of 10.\" So far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when you're running the network, all sorts ofprofitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas prices would spike this winter, Enron'sin-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future supplies at today's prices. And Enron'sstock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of like an Internet play, only better. The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come up with a business model thatworks for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by packaging a supply of name yourcommodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most prices. They arrived at this model backin the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had collapsed, natural-gas deregulation hadthrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just nationalized Enron's offshore properties.Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to it--call it business judo-- Skilling, aMcKinsey & Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas Bank, to buy up reserves of naturalgas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for different customers. When electricitymarkets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the oldest concept in business: buy low, sellhigh. Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big customers. Since 1997, companies likeOwens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, multibillion-dollar contracts with Enronsubsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up to 10 years and provide Enron with asteady revenue stream. What's more, Enron is beginning to actively manage its clients' heating and cooling plants,installing new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the Internet. Skilling's latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the power and energy sectors to making Enrona leader in the booming telecommunications business. The plan isn't to go head to head with established fiber-opticcarriers such as AT&T, Qwest and Williams Communications. Instead, Enron wants to use new switchingtechnology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest telecom network into a powerfularbiter of bandwidth. Enron's bet is simple: supply and demand will increase exponentially, turning bandwidth into atradable commodity, just like gas and electricity. Along the way, why not partner with companies such asBlockbuster and use this new technology to offer content--like movies- -and blow it through existing, underutilizedpipe? \"They are jump- starting an application [telecom content] with a potential market of $200 billion a year,\" saysTom Nolle, president of the telecom consulting firm CIMI. Other new-economy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a prize partner. IBM and AOL havejoined with Enron to form the New Power Co. (TNPC), an independent start-up that will offer pricing schemes and achoice of power and gas service for residential and small-business customers. Enron provides the electricity; AOLenables customers to buy it via the Web; and IBM takes care of the billing. \"It's ludicrous that we're in the 21stcentury, and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters,\" says Skilling, pointing out that thetechnology exists to offer real-time pricing for gas and electricity. In deregulated markets, TNPC will allowconsumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies. Despite all Wall Street's enthusiasm for Enron's bold plans, there are still plenty of skeptics. Critics point out thatthere is barely a market today for the company's bandwidth trading exchange. They also stress that pushing digitalsignals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas. Although there is plenty of cable across the country,carriers are not set up to mix and match access to it. \"It's a very, very difficult concept,\" says Nolles. Even theBlockbuster venture is risky: technology aside, there is also the highly political question of digital rights. How doyou satisfy Hollywood that its content is secure? But Skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought they were crazy to try to make marketsin gas and electricity. And Enron, after all, is a company that thrives on entrepreneurial defiance of convention.Many of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas in motion without waiting forapproval from the top. Even the online operation was cobbled together in a mere seven months. Skilling and Layfound out about EnronOnline only two weeks before it went live. Is taking risks really a part of a gas-pipeline company's culture? Just ask John Arnold, the 26-year-old chief ofnatural-gas derivatives, who after nine hours and $1 billion in trades last Wednesday had this to say: \"You can't turnaway for a minute or you get picked off.\" That has happened to too many traditional companies because they wereunable to find a niche in the new economy. Enron, however, has traded its way into a starring role, and now ithopes it is ready for the movies.

This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for re-election and it is a big vacation week for staff...but here's what I am hearing: As you may or may not know, we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summer's liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, WA. SENATE: In June, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill (S. 2438) out of the Senate Commerce Committee, and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate. Because of the hasty way in which S. 2438 was drafted and passed, there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made -- mostly things that were deal breakers for industry. Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes, including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), John Breaux (D-LA), and Sam Brownback (R-KS). From what I've learned since the accident, these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements. Fortunately, most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident. Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident...the El Paso incident just reinforces those. The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October. The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCain/Gorton legislation, and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations, get agreement from all sides on a bill, and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor. HOUSE: The House is moving a bit more slowly, but again, I'd expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat. There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere, including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ). Franks is now anxious to move legislation, as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility. Before the accident, House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a \"consensus\" bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor. I'm told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly. Unlike our experience in the Senate, we have had significant input into the bill in advance, and expect something that we can live with -- and something more reasonable than the McCain bill. With that said, there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident, so we'll have to see what kind of hand we're dealt in the next few weeks. Overall, I'd expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day. In the absence of this accident, I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment, with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress' precious time. Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process, so that everyone running for election in November can show that they've done something about this terrible tragedy. With that said, there's still not that much time to get legislation through, so I'd say that there's still a chance it may not get done this year. If I had to attach a number to it, I'd say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 50-60%. 2) Gas supply to California: I'll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you. All I've heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line, notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly. I'm sure the power crunch in California will put some counter-pressure on, but I just don't have good intelligence on this yet. With all this said, I'm on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave I've taken for the birth of our new baby daughter, so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week. If you have questions, please respond by e-mail, or leave a message on my voice mail at 202-466-9157. Regards, Jeff Keeler\nAnswer: sensitive"

We would love to get some input from your group on the following questions if possible: 1. What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill, and what is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year? 2. What are people from California saying about the added pressure on gas supplies, and what are people from New Mexico saying about restarting the flow of gas while safety questions remain? These questions come straight from the top, and any information you could provide would be very helpful. Please write me back or call and let me know if/when you think we might be able to get some initial answers. Thanks very much! Clay\nAnswer: The classification label for this text is 'not sensitive"

Here are some more thoughts:FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an \"inc\" situation in real time. Without structural incentives to go short into real time, I would expect the CAISO to \"inc\" in some hours and \"dec\" in others -- with no consistent patterns.The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power: PX Block Forward, PX Day Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post. They had ample opportunity to purchase lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough. That left them short in the Day Ahead. They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some of their load to the Ex Post market. Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.The ISO remains primarily in \"inc\" mode even during the shoulder months when prices are lower, another indicator that the real time \"inc\" problem is driven by the load side rather than the supply side. The IOU's continue to go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market. Does it matter that the price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?The NOx market in California is very tight. How has this contributed to higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any generators from running?How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side? The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest. (I have a theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the west from an economic perspective. I can go into more detail if you wish.)Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets. For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of the state are higher? Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 8/11 and 8/12. There was congestion from California TO the northwest those days in the Day Ahead market. In real time the NW ended up being a net seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is \"workably competitive\" then there is no need for price caps. Is large-scale economic demand response required for a competitive market? What if demand response is there, but at very high prices? The demand response in California is a joke. With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only get around 600 MW of economic demand response. Much of this response comes at $1500/MWh. The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic grounds. So why this assymetric treatment? This gets to the question of the fine line between \"scarcity rents\" which are ok, and market power which is not. If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then shouldn't that be the price. At what price would the rest of the interuptible load economically curtail? Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not to or values power at more than $1500/MWh.Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market power? The reports published to date have been unimpressive. The Market Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then concludes that there is market power. But they never explain why. I would think that proof might be something like this: Generator X sets price y% of the time when loads exceed Z MWs. Or, four generators set price 80% of the time when prices exceed $200/MWh. They have all the data to be able to tell, yet they don't provide any empirical measures. The only test I've heard of so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators are submitting bids above their marginal cost. The PX report states that supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year. They fail to mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to last.\nAnswer: sensitive"

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; I'm sure there are more. 1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead market? 2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 2000? How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities in 2000? 3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than in 1999?4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during Summer 2000?5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work? Why didn't more load participate? 6. What options did SDG&E have to \"hedge\" its retail rates? What were prices in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during Summer 2000?8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps? Is this appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on \"unworkably competitive\" CA ISO markets? Can these be fixed \"quickly\"? Please add other questions. Jim\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees5. Dr. Gene Coyle6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study. There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy componentThe bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy componentThe bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

MITI and the Government are currently examining why the initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and looking to move the 2003 review forward to next year. There are currently two multi party committees looking at the energy sector. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy. In addition, MITI is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to consider the next stage of deregulation. As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved. Recently, with the addition of Kimura, we have increased our level of contact with senior political figures in Japan. Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enron's views on issues relating to the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity deregulation. We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist in the deregulation process in a positive way. What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be structured in the future. Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will receive a cabinet position if Gov. Bush is elected. As a result, Mr Lay currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in Japan. In the period prior to the Presidential election, we have an ideal opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese Government through Mr Lay. A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government members would significantly increase Enron's profile in Japan and assist in conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation. If Mr Lay were to visit Japan, possibly in late October or early November, we would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and arrange a number of high level commercial meetings. Prime Minister Mori and the US Ambassador have already expressed an interest in attending the office opening. Both Joe Hirl and I would like to speak with you further about the above. When would be a convenient time? kind regards\nAnswer: sensitive"

JAMES FLANIGAN: Simple Steps May Ease Self-Inflicted Electricity Woes Los Angeles Times -- August 25, 2000 [Return to Headlines] > Publication Date: Friday August 25, 2000 Page C-1 Los Angeles Times (Home Edition) Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company By JAMES FLANIGAN Let's be clear, the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason California's electricity market is such a mess. But failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as California's economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of today's shortages and soaring prices in San Diego, Orange County and other areas. Still, some simple steps can be taken by regulators, legislators and Gov. Gray Davis to provide immediate relief. The state's major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it. They should not have to buy exclusively from the Power Exchange, the Pasadena-based power pool that was set up by the 1998 deregulation to achieve auction-based prices for roughly 80% of the state's electricity. Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand. That could alleviate a tight supply-demand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built. Long term, the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants. The state also should force utilities to invest in the still-regulated system of power transmission lines, which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas. Perhaps the most glaring fact about California's electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market, the nation's biggest. Only 15 or so suppliers, including federal agencies, the state's own utilities, municipal companies and private generating firms, supply power to California's system. By contrast, Pennsylvania, which has an electricity market less than 12% the size of California's, has 130 separate suppliers of electricity today, reports John Quain, chairman of that state's Public Utility Commission. It's no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop 3% on average since deregulation. \"It's worked out terrifically,\" Quain says. What did California do wrong? It allowed the state's major utilities--Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric--to recover 100% of their unrecovered or \"stranded\" costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy. Then California's legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies, all of which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange. The California scheme was flawed, at once over-regulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers. How did Pennsylvania do it? It allowed the state's utilities to recover no more than 67% of their stranded costs for nuclear plants--reasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments. And rather than set up a central power exchange, the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the state's electric system to compete for business. Competition, after all, is what deregulation is supposed to encourage. And competition is not happening in California. It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West. All the Western states are suffering electricity problems. That's another reason for California's trouble. Normally, 28% of California's electricity comes from U.S. and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington, Nevada and Arizona. But this year, because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states, power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it. Now there are accusations that some suppliers to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power. There's nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques, as some generators may have done. If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion, federal and other investigations will determine the facts. But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us? The California regulators, legislators and utilities did. Told to sell their generating plants in 1998, the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers. They received premium prices from buyers such as AES Corp., Duke Energy, Southern Co. Reliant Energy, Dynegy and NRG. The premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers. Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries. Nobody in the Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power Exchange could be held up by market leverage. As outsiders often say about Californians: \"Maybe it's the sunshine makes them slow.\" (END) 05:23 EDT August 25, 2000 Copyright , 2000 Times Mirror Company >\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

The intranet site will be placed on the home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your California Power Issue needs. The database has been populated with the latest information that I have received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has then been broken down further into subcategories. The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have access to this information. The secured document section contains all the information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these documents should not be restricted. To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go to this link: http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf (It is best if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape browser.) Once you are at this site you will be able to access all articles and information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, go to this link and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter your new network password.) There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-4382. Thanks, Gavin\nAnswer: sensitive"

Let me know what I can do to help. You are correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions, particularly the US. What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel selection is: gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised. Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation). Again, I don't recall this ever being an issue. It seems to work: outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs By Rebecca Smith 09/01/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A4 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power rates to levels seen prior to deregulation . Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that commodity price. The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier. Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to schools and hospitals. In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost. Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the rate-cap measure is \"deeply flawed\" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or December 2003. Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through December 2002. \"It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,\" he said because it \"creates tremendous uncertainty\" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance new projects such as a new transmission line. The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that review the plans.

I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC \"overpayment\". Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC \"overpayment\"? On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the \"overpayment\" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period. Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs. I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check. On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct. PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to \"collect\" the overpayment of Negative CTC. All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its \"Est RT$\". If I am right, that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the \"HC\" or \"Est RT$\" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Co-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor Bob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to be an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the current and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North America. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including senior government officials and senior executives of companies critically involved in the energy value chain. Primary Goals of the Summit include: * Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas market * Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply potential for gas * Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss natural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of interested State Governors. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have asked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to moderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply Response for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening framework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at the close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working with the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine Hansen. We hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to view the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at: http://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm\nAnswer: not sensitive"

We have helped them to find out which German journalists the German gas incumbent, Ruhrgas, has sent to California this week. We found out about that yesterday. I have now passed on that list + some general PR recommendations and EFET will now take the lead on this (they will send out an EFET position paper on California and have a spokesperson available especially for California - he's not Enron!). Just wanted to make sure you are aware because it could be possible that people will come to us for further comment. The general consensus now is that we then refer them to EFET.

Up to you now to send them the EFET position paper on California. Would suggest you try to get it on their desk by Monday morning latest, if possible. Would also send it to those who have refused to go and other key contacts we have given to you. Media seems to be keen to know EFET's position on this. Let me know if you need translation of the personalised note that will accompany the position paper. Obviously, we will divert any requests we get to you. Will get their email addresses to you later so you can email it to them rather than fax it with the possibility they will get it too late. Good luck.

Journalists in Califonia:-Werner Sturbeck (FAZ - Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung)-Werner Jaspert (S_ddeutsche Zeitung)-Dr. J_rgen Frech (WAZ - Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung-Jochen Schuster (Focus) Journalists that had been invited but refused:-Dr. Andreas Wildhagen (Wirtschaftswoche)-Hans-Willy Bein (Financial Times Deutschland)-Die Welt I also got the information that Ruhrgas held a press conference yesterdayin California. So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrowor latest on Monday. I also will do an additional internet monitoring (forexample WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there arealready some articles. We should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to thosejournalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts. Most ofthe journalists I spoke to or colleagues from the newsdesk seem to be keen toknow what EFET has to say about the California issue!!!!! Please let me know if you need further information!Best regards,\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account). I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions.

The school is also happy and wantsto strengthen its relationship with Enron. They had earlier this year contacted a Laura Kalmans, Director of Community Development at Enron, to discuss various ideas for cooperation with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and give the studentsexposure to real world issues, but nothing happened and they lost contact. They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I said I thought it might be you or someone under you. They now want to send a letterto someone at Enron on this proposal. It is OK if it is addressed to you or should I tellthem another name? Please advise me how to steer them in the right direction. Many thanks.

Thank you for generously offering to help usexplore this connection. We believe there are strong synergies between Professor Bill Moomaw'sInternational Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business model. There iscurrently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there are nine Fletcheritesat Enron at this time. I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship is a solid first stepfrom which to launch an even stronger partnership. In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director of CommunityDevelopment, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring. Unfortunately, the schedulingdid not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had trouble identifying a newpoint of contact. I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean. As Senior Vice President forPublic and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal contact with whom todiscuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we proceed? Should we senda letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to meet with ProfessorMoomaw? May I mention that you suggested we write him? At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared for Enron, along withthe letter we originally mailed to Elise. I would be very interested in any suggestions you mayhave. If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, please let me know andI would be happy to mail or fax them. Thank you again for your kind offer of assistance.

Lay, the chairman, recently sent top executives a memo on his stationery asking them to contribute$1,000 each to the Bush campaign, said Steven J. Kean, an executive vice president. This year, Enron and itsemployees have contributed more than $615,000 to the Bush campaign, he said. But there are limits, even at companies like Enron. ''We might tell employees to go out and vote, but nobody tellsthem who to vote for or passes out brochures,'' Mr. Kean said. ''That kind of thing is just not acceptable in today'sworkplace.''

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- While federal regulators try to find a way tostabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California, Enron Corp.(ENE) has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities tosell them fixed-price power at a lower rate. In the past month, the Houston-based electricity service provider enteredinto long-term fixed-rate contracts with the city of Roseville and isnegotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista. Bothof those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas & Electric Co, aunit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE), and pay market rates for electricity. Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.(HOT), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the companyelectricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. The company has four hotelsin California, three of which buy their power from SDG&E. Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotelpower at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 22.5 cents/KWhStarwood said it was charged by SDG&E in August. Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. But Starwood said itexpects to reduce its energy costs by more than $200 million over the next 10years. Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the U.S., willpurchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use itsexperience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like SDG&E foruse of their distribution networks. \"That really is our core strength,\" said Harold Buchanan, chief operatingofficer for Enron Energy Services North America. \"We understand how to managethose risks.\" High Rates Driving Industrial Customers, Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comebackof sorts for Enron. The Houston-based company had tried to break into California's retail powermarket just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertisethe venture during the Super Bowl. But Enron gave up trying to win residentialcustomers in 1998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expectedprofits. That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full ofpromise. Oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack inCalifornia, soaring power prices are building demand for Enron's services. The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diegothat have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and areinterested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, Buchanan said. \"Overall, what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego that'swritten in stone,\" Buchanan said. \"It's far cheaper than what they're payingnow with the utilities.\" A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined tocomment. The city of Roseville, near Sacramento, entered into a $114 million contractwith Enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five yearsat $49 per megawatt-hour. Furthermore, the city has started talks with Enron about building andoperating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officialsexpect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity. Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the pricespikes that have plagued customers of SDG&E since June. San Marcos, in San Diego County, is proposing to switch electricity servicefor its 10,000 residents to Enron from SDG&E - a move the City Council saidcould shave about $12 million a year off the city's power bill. Enron has saidit would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville. An SDG&E spokesman said last week that the utility supports sucharrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work. Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDG&E itself for fouryears at a fixed rate of 5.5 cents/KWh, but the utility said the price was toohigh. California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to capelectricity rates for SDG&E's customers at 6.5 cents/KWh. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com Folder Name: Enron Energy ServicesRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 80 ______________________________________________________________________ To review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

Business; Financial Desk State's Power Grid Again Pushed to Brink of Rolling Blackouts Energy: High temperatures, generator shutdowns push usage within 5% of capacity. Heat wave is expected to continue today. NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 09/19/2000 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-1 Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company Sweltering weather across California pushed the state's heat-stressed electricity grid close to meltdown Monday, and state power officials urged electricity conservation because today and Wednesday could be even worse. Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about 125,000 residential and business air-conditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after the California Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid for about 75% of the state, declared a Stage 2 power emergency. At Stage 2, when the grid is using more than 95% of available power, the state's big investor-owned utilities are asked to interrupt power to customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for discounted rates. Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern California stopped working for a time as heavy air-conditioner demand began to push power use higher, Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said. Demand peaked at about 42,000 megawatts on the Cal-ISO grid, but the two unidentified units, representing about 320 megawatts of generation, were returned to service in the afternoon--in time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage 3, which would lead to neighborhood blackouts. \"We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage 3,\" McCorkle said. \"A couple of generators fell offline in late morning, and that kind of gave everybody a scare.\" A Stage 3 emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below 1.5%--in essence, when the electricity grid is using more than 98.5% of available power--and rotating outages of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep the grid from failing. That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hours. Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, peaking near 4,750 megawatts Monday. But DWP customers were not threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the municipal utility has more than enough generating capacity to meet demand. \"We're doing OK as we have all summer long,\" said DWP General Manager S. David Freeman. Cal-ISO asked Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric to call on all of their interruptible-power customers to immediately stop using electricity, representing a potential 3,000 megawatts, or roughly the amount of electricity used by 3 million homes. Thousands of students at College of the Canyons in Valencia experienced the California equivalent of a snow day Monday when power outage alarms rang about 1:30 p.m, the seventh time this year, college spokesman Sue Bozman said. If the college doesn't pull the plug, it pays a big fine. \"For several years, we saved $100,000 a year by being on this interruptible-service plan,\" said Bozman, who with other administrators finished the work day with mobile phones and portable computers. \"But when the alarm rings and we decline to turn off our power, it's a whole different ballgame.\" One such day in May, during final exams, the college didn't cut power and penalties totaled $30,000, she said. During the height of Monday's power crisis, PG&E--whose territory suffered local blackouts on June 14 in a similar reliability emergency--kept an open telephone line to Cal-ISO for minute-by-minute updates, spokesman Ron Low said. SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity as possible, and grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other power use to comply. \"We're issuing a call to action, a call that everyone needs to take seriously,\" Pam Bass, SCE's senior vice president for customer service, said in a statement as electricity use soared Monday. \"If the demand for power does not decrease soon, we will be directed by the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers. Everyone needs to cut their use of power now to avoid forced outages.\" Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging: Cal-ISO is predicting peak use of 44,827 megawatts for today. Peak demand was expected to be 44,537 megawatts on Monday, but conservation and power-interruption programs kept the total lower. \"We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today,\" SCE spokeswoman Karen Shepard-Grimes said Monday. Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at 17,860 megawatts before the Rosemead-based utility asked power customers to cut 2,500 megawatts of electricity. \"It got really touchy today,\" she said. * Times staff writer Zanto Peabody contributed to this report.

In this case, FERC stated that \"a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . .\" and specifically rejected the use of a \"trial-type evidentiary hearing.\" Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate \"paper\" hearings with \"trial-type\" hearings; see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>>Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh.

Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. \"We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,\" said Larry Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. \"We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it, let's pay for it.\" Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he said, \"were wildly high.\" \"The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, \" Maviglio said. \"Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities, you can't conclude anything.\" The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion in debt. PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies. \"The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,\" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. \"Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large.\" Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor. COST VS. OUTAGESIf given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. \"I don't like either choice,\" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store. \"But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the blackouts.\" Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within \"the existing rate structure\" -- a stealthy way of saying that January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place. But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. \"For the good of California, it's inevitable,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry association. Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. \"It's like gasoline,\" he said. \"I don't like paying higher prices for gasoline, but that's the price of doing business.\" Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. \"If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,\" said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty. \"But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling blackouts.\" \"I'd rather have blackouts,\" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. \"I don't want to pay rates that are so much higher.\" NOT EVERY COST PALATABLEThis is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way. Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond. \"Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,\" said Tom Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison. Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to do so. Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures. \"It adjusts consumer behavior,\" Higgins said. \"People want to get their bills back down.\" RATES' EFFECT ON USAGEHe and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. \"It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,\" Higgins said. Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear: No, no, no. \"No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,\" said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"We need to get back to a regulated system.\" Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento. \"We've paid too much already,\" Rosenfield said. \"A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease.\" However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. \"Big users should pay more,\" he said after a moment's reflection. \"I'm open to a tiered system but only if it's fair.\" Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis. MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATESClearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months, if not longer. PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. \"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,\" she said. \"People who use a whole lot of power should pay more.\" The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. \"That way, you have more convenience and electricity, more stability,\" she said. But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate increases and rolling blackouts. She's moving to Texas.

Energy Is HotBy Christopher Edmonds Special to TheStreet.com9/20/00 12:47 PM ET URL: http://www.thestreet.com/comment/christopheredmonds/1088836.htmlHOUSTON -- Up and to the right. That could be the theme of the eighth annual Dain Rauscher Wessels energy conference this week in America's self-proclaimed oil capital. Between the whispers in the hallways and the bullish presentations from an overflowing barrel of oil, gas and power companies, you might think you were in the corridors of some Silicon Valley conference of yesteryear. But, no, this is all about energy, and energy is hot. With oil hanging around $37 per barrel and natural gas solidly above $5 per million BTU, oil, gas and power stocks have caught fire. To illustrate, take a look at the chart of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Sector Index, or OSX: Up and to the right. And, a great deal of the price gain is rational. As the price of the commodities increases, profits follow. That should mean positive earnings from a plethora of oil and gas companies. While new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations have stifled the more explicit (now illicit) preannouncements at conferences like this, regulations can't cap all the enthusiasm from rising commodity prices. For example, Kenneth Lay, chairman of energy powerhouse Enron (ENE:NYSE), said at the conference he is very comfortable with analysts' estimates, hinting the numbers are conservative. \"We should meet or exceed analysts' expectations for the quarter and the year.\" Others followed suit. Bradley Fischer, president of CMS Energy Oil and Gas (CMS:NYSE), (profiled here earlier ), said his company will post \"record production and record income this year,\" because the fundamentals of the oil and gas business are as good as they have been in his career. \"I've been in this business 28 years. The first 10 were good and the last 18 have been difficult. Now, I'm looking for the good times to roll.\" And this from Diana Naylor, senior vice president at independent power producer Calpine (CPN:NYSE), when reacting to analysts' estimates in the coming year. \"We look to be making that number and look to increase that [guidance on earnings] shortly.\" Even the oil drillers and equipment companies are celebrating. Nabors Industries (NBR:AMEX), owner of the largest land-drilling fleet, thinks analysts are significantly underestimating its potential. Dain Rauscher estimates Nabors will earn 83 cents per share this year and $1.65 next year -- numbers Chairman and CEO Eugene Isenberg called conservative. He presented calculations suggesting the company could earn $3.27 in the middle of the oil cycle and has the ability to earn $6.81 in the coming years. \"The probability of this happening is very high,\" he said. All because of $37 per barrel oil and $5 gas? While there is little question that third- and fourth-quarter earnings should be strong, there is growing concern that the oil and gas stock rally has been overdone. Not only have stocks tracked the rise in commodity prices but the once-beleaguered sector has also seen earnings multiples expand significantly. That is a warning sign to at least one analyst. While the going is good, the rapid price rise isn't sustainable. Oil stocks stocks \"will peak in the next several weeks and trade sideways, probably for the rest of the year,\" said Jim Wicklund, head of energy research at Dain Rauscher, adding that there may be added selling pressure as funds try to lock in gains before the end of the year. \"Stock [price pressure] will also be impacted by portfolio managers' bonus structure.\" And Wicklund warned that what he sees as the inevitable moderation in oil prices will put pressure on the stocks into the new year. \"Right or wrong, stock prices are slaves to commodity prices.\" If Wicklund is correct, the next move could be down and to the left. The Peoples CourtOne of the clever and unique features of the Dain Rauscher Wessels energy conference is the annual investor poll. This year, nearly 400 investors responded to the on-site survey and, while the results aren't scientific, they are likely instructive.

However, survey participants do not see the same pattern for natural gas, with estimates for gas prices remaining well above $4.50 through next year. And what may at first appear to be good news for George W. Bush probably isn't. A six-point lead looks nice, but remember -- we're on his home turf, Texas, among his brethren in the oil business. For W., that may suggest down and to the left as well.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Incidentally, I was with Sue Tierney at a NARUC conference yesterday and we've started a new pool to wager when Congress will get this issue dealt with. Want in? Perhaps you remember that while we were serving on the Task Force I moved to EPRI to direct their government relations.? Last year I moved back to Missouri to run the municipals' state joint action agency, which is why I'm writing.? Part of our activity is operating a 19 city power pool (MoPEP) that has a three year supply contract of up to 40 mWh/hr with Enron.? We've had some difficulties with delivery since a change in tagging was made in June.The issue and a proposed solution is explained in the attached three page \"bullet statement\" that we've just submitted to the new NERC Security Subcommittee that meets tomorrow.? Based on his discussions with NERC staff, with a Mike Curry with Enron and other affected utilities, my chief operating officer for MoPEP is optimistic about prospects for this resolution.? I would like to make sure of Enron's support.? I'm told that Dick Ingersoll will be at the subcommittee meeting for Enron, and I know Dick from SPP meetings when I was on the Missouri Commission but don't have contact information on him now.? I'd be very grateful if you could pass along a nod of benign interest in this. We'd greatly appreciate Enron's support for the proposed resolution of the tagging issue at the NERC Subcommittee tomorrow, mainly because it should avoid what might otherwise be a messy contract dispute, at FERC or elsewhere, between our organizations.? Without getting into the details, my understanding of the issue under the energy purchase agreement has to do with whether the change in NERC tagging that was required on June 1 (the date when MoPEP started taking certain control area services from Western Resources) affects Enron's obligation under the agreement to deliver energy to the Associated Electric Cooperative transmission system.? MoPEP's view is that Enron's obligations are unaffected, but some at Enron apparently have had a different view.? Our belief is that the proposal that will be presented to the Security Subcommittee will resolve the tagging matter such that both Enron and MoPEP would regard any potential dispute on this issue as moot. Sorry for such short notice, but this resolution and taking it to the subcommittee came out of discussions in Atlanta Friday. Thanks for your consideration, Steve.? Hope all is well with you.

We now have marketing prototypes made, patents in place, outstanding consumer interest and are ready to proceed to the next step. The Angle Master can be very large or small.. The output gear smoothly transitions from 0-90 degrees at high torque to to reach or drill any angle. The input gear can be driven by any device. No product on the market can perform like the Angle Master. I can see the use of the Angle Master for various drilling applications, including horizontal drilling Professional mechanics in all fields who have seen the smaller Angle Master all want one. We have endorsements from professional drivers, mechanics, and many others. A recently retired Captain of a nuclear aircraft carrier has stated in a letter \"....The use of the Angle Master.... will result in a significant time savings which in turn will increase combat readiness of aircraft and ships due to the more rapid turnaround of out of commission systems. Every mechanic will want the Angle Master in their toolbox after they have seen it in operation.\" A Senior Vice President of Operations for a major Aerospace Company has stated in writing \" .... Prototype manufacturing, tool manufacturing, assembly, repair and overhaul operations will all benefit from the flexibility of the Angle Master.\" The attached web page location underlined below is not yet completed, but it indicates just a few of thesmaller scale uses for the Angle Master.

The power subsidy proposal was drafted by a Washington energy consultant whois one of Gore's closest advisers on the environment. One of the majorbeneficiaries of the plan would be a power company notorious for pollutingthe atmosphere. To close the circle, the company has used the Gore adviseras a paid consultant. In polishing up his energy program, Gore played a variation on his LosAngeles acceptance speech's populistic attack on certain categories ofbusiness that have broken no law. This time, the target was the energyindustry (\"Big Oil\"), assailed for benefitting from the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries' manipulation of oil prices. But Gore is noacross-the-board enemy of corporate America. He always takes care offriends. While positioning himself as the foe of Big Oil, he emerges as thefriend of Big Power. In that category is American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, andone of the Midwest's biggest supplier of coal-generated power. AEP, sued bythe Environmental Protection Agency last year for alleged violation of theClear Air Act, is widely viewed as a pariah by the environmentalistmovement. It is accused of running one of the dirtiest operations togenerate power. AEP frequently has paid for advice from environmental advocate Kathleen A.McGinty, who has an unusual resume indeed. As senior legislative assistantfor energy and environmental policy to then-Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee, she quickly gained a reputation on Capitol Hill as a passionateadvocate for global climate control. Gore picked her for Clinton administration posts, enabling her to affectnational policy in a major way. In 1993, she was named to head the new WhiteHouse Office on Environmental Policy. In 1996, she was promoted to head theCouncil on Environmental Quality and became a leader in trying to sell toAmerica the massively unpopular 1997 Gore-promoted Kyoto Treaty (neverconsidered by the Senate) to slash energy consumption. Last year, McGinty emerged as a consultant with the law and lobbying firm ofTroutman Sanders. There, she has been engaged in an interesting balancingact. On the one hand, she advised AEP and the Atlanta-based Southern Co.,another power giant. On the other, she moonlighted for Gore in drafting theJune 27 energy plan. Since July, she has been working full time for theDemocratic National Committee. Gore's plan promises to \"clean up the nation's aging power plants by usingmarket-based enforcement and comprehensive standards to reduce pollution andincrease efficiency.\" It offers \"a menu of financial mechanisms\" to \"thosepower plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise todramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution.\" That means a big subsidy for electric power companies to help them clean uptheir plants. According to congressional energy sources, AEP would receivemillions of dollars to get right environmentally. Gore always has shown ability to reward individual corporate friends whilecastigating big business as predators. I previously reported that he hadsupported permission for deep oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico,desired only by Occidental Petroleum Corp., the source of much of hisfamily's wealth. But federal help for Occidental and American Power and the potential forconflicts of interest fly beneath the radar in a capital where the hands ofneither political party are clean. It is possible for Gore's diluted brandof populism to flourish because it is the way Washington works.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Due to technical difficulties, I could not attach the letter in a separate document, so I copied the letter and have reprinted it below. Having never been involved in this type of letter writing campaign, this was a bit of a stab in the dark for me, so I welcome everyone's comments. I am also working on a letter that could be sent by senior management or CEOs of high tech firms, but I wanted to get your feedback on this format before I went forward on the high tech letter. Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Sarah September 26, 2000 The Honorable James HoeckerFederal Energy Regulatory Commission888 First Street, N.E.Washington, D.C. Re: Electric Power Industry Reform Dear Chairman Hoecker: We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power. We write to urge you and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable shortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in the electric power industry. It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supply of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers. There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that the power supply in the U.S. remains sufficient and is available at reasonable prices. For example, you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in the nation=01,s electricity gird. Under the current system, FERC regulations allow many companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers. The result of this policy is shortages, blackouts and skyrocketing prices. Like the interstate highway system, FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to another just as freely as motorists do. All electricity suppliers should have the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power to where it is most needed. FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers=01, reliance on spot and short-term electricity markets for power supply. Instead, FERC should urge suppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term contracts. Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers from unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating. We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these reforms. Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more reliable and economical. Very truly yours,\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states (Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating season (Nov-Mar). Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead prices for the 2000-2001 winter period. A national projection is also included. Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced than for commercial or industrial customers. In addition, LDC purchased gas cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 months in some cases). Furthermore, some state public utility commissions (e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois). If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have comments with respect to the above let me know.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I think the electricity section needs some additions though. There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision. Further, the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis. Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid. The answer is open access, so power can get from where it is to where it is needed. This has been clear for a long time, yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen. The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

In the Senate:The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.Burton announced during one of the two \"informational\" hearings that \"this is it,\" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.The key features of the bill are:Banks and QFs get paid in full.Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliersNo direct access.There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly:The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).We're attempting to get the \"July 12\" date changed to \"the effective date of the bill\" or later.The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem:The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a \"fair\" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting. That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short, little has changed since yesterday. Best,Jeff\nAnswer: sensitive"

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet. In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points:There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market. We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well.High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt. The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity. They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices. My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme.The market would function better if more information was provided to the market.The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint. When you do, you will find there are many \"hidden\" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information. According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators. Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is looking into the data we provided. I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday. Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message. On Friday, Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions. Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online. He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity .\nAnswer: sensitive"

I was flying over Bolivia's Chiquitano Forest as I read your article on the \"old-time gas company\" Enron [BUSINESS, Aug. 28]. Over the past year, this forest, the largest remnant of intact primary dry tropical forest in the world, has been bisected by a 30-ft.-wide gash for construction of a gas pipeline by Enron and Shell. Enron in its quest for profit has ignored the scientific advice of conservation organizations to maintain the ecological integrity of this endangered forest ecosystem. Enron and Shell decided to open the 10 million- acre forest to fragmentation and deforestation by their pipeline. Enron may be keeping pace with advancing technologies to plow ahead in global markets, but its environmental practices are Byzantine and pose a global threat to biodiversity. PATRICIA CAFFREY World Wildlife Fund-Bolivia Santa Cruz, Bolivia Arena foes launch bid to defeat new plan By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Wednesday, October 4, 2000A handful of activists, including a Harris County Green Party official and several low-tax proponents, launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a second plan to build a downtown arena. Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year's anti-arena movement is not seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arena at all. Although this year's opponents lack the nearly $700,000 their higher-profile predecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish their rhetoric. \"Should we spend our city's limited resources on building up rich guys, or do we spend it building up our communities?\" asked activist DeWayne Lark, standing in front of City Hall. \"There will be no more corporate welfare in Harris County.\" Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday's event, which came about three weeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend than for who did. Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year's anti-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former city councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, also supports the new agreement. And although the Harris County Republican Party -- the primary organizer of the 1999 anti-arena effort -- has declined to support the new deal, it has not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped. In the GOP's stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented by Nathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professional sports are critical to a city's identity. Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston's image as a world-class city. \"Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at the drop of a hat,\" she said. And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservative political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major role in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager. Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arena campaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically active family that can raise large amounts of money. Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building sports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get involved in the anti-arena effort. Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the arena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this week to collect contributions. The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 1996 form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to build a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort also opposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extract a better deal from team owners. Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, and certainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal, which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points. Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profile contests. \"We never expected this to be a unanimous vote,\" said Jordan, the co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign, Let's Build it Together. \"Some people will vote against anything.\" FRANCE: Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers.By Stuart Penson 10/03/2000Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2000. PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe's power markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure on traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday. Scores of web-based trading platforms, offering a variety of functions, are expected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term, forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach, they told an energy conference.\"Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think we're going to see a big decline over the next six months,\" said Gilbert Toppin, principal of Deloitte Consulting's European e-business practice. \"Voice broking could become a distant memory,\" he told Reuters during the Powerisk 2000 conference. Leading the online charge in Europe's wholesale power market are EnronOnline, which launched last year, and HoustonStreet.com, which started up last week and is already planning to expand into Scandinavia. EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to a deal. HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange. The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen as lower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range of prices to clients. Also, online trading is anonymous, which is attractive to traders, said Mark Crosno, president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologies of the US. Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK, a consortium which runs a screen-based gas trading market and is planning to launch a power exchange. Many traditional brokers are still deciding how to respond to the online challenge. \"A lot of brokers are scratching their heads because there are going to be 20 or 25 electronic exchanges out there,\" said Per-Otto Wold, managing director of Natsource-Tullett Europe, one of Europe's biggest power brokers. Wold argued that doing a trade over the telephone was still, in most cases, the quickest method. And that would remain so until voice recognition enabled traders to \"talk\" to the screens on their desks. He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while online markets would capture a greater share of trading in short term, high volume contracts. The provision of market information and traders' liking for personal contact over the telephone would also help to preserve a niche for the voice brokers, said Wold. \"The markets are still going to need somebody to massage the markets, and that is where the brokers come in,\" he said.

They list a fundraising goal of $1,660,000 (just a bit aggressive!) If we are not able to make an additional contribution, he asks that we renew our 2001 annual membership of $40,000 now instead of in January of 2001. If we do anything, my recommendation would be to cut a check now for our annual membership (the downside of doing that, of course, is that they will hit us a number of times in 2001 for incremental contributions to specific events/causes). I bring this to your attention for two reasons-one is that if I know Governor Gilmore, he will probably make a call directly to Ken Lay and you and Steve may want to have an answer available if Mr. Lay gets the call. Secondly, what are your thoughts on my response to RGA? My preference would be to not commit to any additional dollars, with a fall back that if Gilmore does call Lay and he wants to respond positively, we then commit to renewing our membership early. I think you are pretty busy over the next few days--please respond as your schedule allows. THanks.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Twice in the last three months I have run into the Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by Stan Horton who had decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when AGA \"kicked\" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of sub membership for around 85K. AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got back to them as promised. This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be calling Lay. It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.\nAnswer: sensitive"

The partners will build a natural-gas-fired power stationwhose 500-megawatt capacity will represent 30 percent of thecountry's current electricity demand, said Fenosa in a note,confirmed with the company. The generator will run on liquefied natural gas when itstarts operating in 2002, switching to fuel from the re-gasification plant when it starts operating in 2003. Fenosa has had an alliance with International Power Plc,formerly National Power Plc, since 1998. That alliance focuses onEurope, the U.S. and Australia, a Fenosa spokeswoman said today. Enron was the first U.S. utility to receive licenses to buy,sell and import electricity in Spain, after the government startedopening energy markets to competition in 1998. It's also licensedto market natural gas. The Texas-based utility is building a gas-fired power plantin southern Spain, has a wind turbine factory near Toledo, andplans another windmill factory in Catalonia. --Brooke Nelson in the Madrid bureau (34 91) 700-9600 orb.nelson@bloomberg.net /ph Story illustration: UNF SM <Equity> COMP D to chart Fenosa'sperformance against the IBEX index. TOP NRG DJ Union Fenosa/Enron -2: Construction To Begin 2001 >E.FEN10/10/0 12:40 (New York) MADRID (Dow Jones)--Spanish electricity company Union Electrica Fenosa SA(E.FEN) said late Tuesday it has reached an agreement with U.S. energy companyEnron (ENE) to invest in energy infrastructure projects in the DominicanRepublic. In a release, Fenosa said the deal involves the construction of acombined-cycle power plant with a 500MW potency, which will use natural gasfrom a regasification plant on the island nation. The 500MW potency is equivalent to 30% of the Caribbean island's electricitydemand. The deal also includes a complimentary project, Fenosa said. This is theconstruction of a regasification plant on the republic's coastline, with acapacity for treating gas equivalent to the consumption of various groups ofcombined-cycle plants with a potency of 1300MW. The investment for these two projects is seen at around $550 million, ofwhich $100 million could come from Dominican companies, Fenosa said. Fenosa and Enron estimate that construction of the two projects will begin inearly 2001, with the power plant coming online in 2002. It will operate withcombustible liquid until 2003, at which time the regasification plant comesonline. (MORE) DOW JONES NEWS 10-10-00 12:40 PM- - 12 40 PM EDT 10-10-00\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

With RTOs, he supposedly said this meant if the rules are standardized, the number of RTOs becomes less important. Those in the room, including EPSA staff, came away with the impression that Wood is backing away from only 4 RTOs based on this and other comments. Ditto on a 12/15/01 deadline. On the positive side, he did say that he had been consulted on the Administration's comments on the Bingaman bill and agreed that legislation without RTO language or bundled/unbundled is OK.

Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra. ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that would give ENA access to their assets. In short, ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small commercial customers). ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate). We're meeting with Sempra's \"Chief Regulatory Office\" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss. Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer. For electricity, the plan has two pieces: 1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) \"Deal Bench\" services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces). Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions. We'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday. Best,Jeff\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Quinn BODY: Southern Co. appears to be on the verge of losing a big-money power struggle over control of its four-state electricity transmission system. But both sides in the tug-of-war offer different takes on which result would help consumers and which would hurt them. At issue are long-distance transmission lines, mounted on huge steel towers, that carry electricity across state lines to towns and cities. Atlanta-based Southern Co. has invested $ 3 billion in its 26,000-mile system, but federal regulators want it to cede control to a larger agency that covers eight states. The matter is coming to a head now after three years of wrangling. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants to carve up the country into four regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West. Under such a plan, local utilities like Southern would be unable to stop competing power shipments from out-of-state suppliers. Regional transmission organizations \"yield significant customer savings,\" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. Commission spokeswoman Barbara Connors said lower rates will result when barriers to competitively priced electricity from outside the region are dropped and transmission costs reduced. But there are sharp differences of opinion on that score. Andy Dearman, Southern Co.'s chief transmission officer, cites estimates that a super-regional agency could cost more than $ 100 million to establish, and he says those costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. According to Georgia Power Co., a Southern Co. subsidiary, transmission costs already account for about 6.5 percent of Georgia electricity bills. There's also a question of reliability when a new system is established, Dearman saud. \"It impacts the ability to keep the lights on,\" he said. Some state regulators, who stand to lose regulatory control, see a Washington power grab. \"We've got low prices and a reliable system,\" said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Stan Wise, who sees a back-door move toward utility deregulation of the sort that has failed with electricity in California and been severely tested with natural gas in Georgia. \"Don't tell me about the new system when I've got blood on my face from the last battle,\" Wise said. \"There are some parallels that make us squirm.\" PSC Chairman Lauren \"Bubba\" McDonald wrote President Bush following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks urging a delay. \"This is not the time to consider or implement any change to the management of the nation's transmission grid,\" he said. But the federal commission has only toughened its position. Wood, a Texan recently named chairman by Bush, said last month he wants to use the commission's authorities as a \"stick\" to force reluctant utilities into line. Wood would deny utilities that refuse to join a \"new world\" of regional power grids by Dec. 15 the authority to charge deregulated prices and delay merger approvals for those firms. The commission plans a series of workshops in Washington next week for what Wood called the \"brightest minds available\" in the utility field to brainstorm over transmission reorganization plans. Southern Co. is sending a representative. Companies like Enron Corp., the Texas-based national energy suppler, are pressing for RTOs as the first step toward a national transmission grid -- a concept favored by the Bush administration. Prodded by federal regulators, Southern Co. in June agreed to dilute its control over the 26,000-mile system by joining with public power agencies in five states to form a larger, 39,000-mile transmission agency to be operated by an outside company. But a federal mediator rejected the plan. The issue has also split Southern Co. from onetime subsidiary Mirant Corp., an independent power company with plans to expand into the Southeast. Large regional grids are \"more cost-effective and reliable\" than the present territorial hodgepodge, said Mirant spokesman Buddy Eller. By encouraging development of new and cleaner power plants, the environment would benefit too, he added. But Wise called such predictions \"totally unproven.\" Carin NersesianLegislative CoordinatorEnron Corp.202-466-9144 202-828-3372 (fax)\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Overall, the message on RTOs and restructuring was very positive. Gov. Taft and Chairman Schriber strongly endorsed FERC's recent moves regarding RTO's. Also, all talk on restructuring is to move forward and not backwards towards re-regulation. There was also consensus on adopting a national energy policy -- and many speakers linked a national energy policy to national security. Following is a brief summary of comments from various speakers: Senator Voinvich: Supports Congress passing a national energy policy by the end of the year. His concerns include: need to develop nuclear energy -- said he and Sen. Lander are working on a bill; impact of high energy prices on low income consumers and small businesses b/c we are too reliant on natural gas (did not offer any alternatives to heating w/ gas); the need to harmonize energy and environmental policies (business and environmentalists need to come to the table); very opposed to Sen. Jefford's multi-emissions bill - called it a \"threat to Ohio's economy\" - said he is working with others on a compromise; new source review problem needs to be fixed; and if new ambient air standards go into effect then entire state of OH will be out of compliance. Governor Taft: Announced that he is forming a Federal Energy Policy Group to build consensus in Ohio on promoting the development of wholesale markets that will lead to strong retail markets. PUCO Chair Schriber will chair this group. The Governor's staff learned this at the same time the rest of us did. I have asked Tom Winters to follow through with the governor's office to find out what their plans are. I told him we likely would be interested in having a spot in the group. He is going to look into this further and get back to me. The Governor announced that transmission issues, particularly RTOs are his highest priority. He also announced the Smart Community Challenge Awards for communities that decrease energy use. Also, October is officially Ohio Energy Month. Senate President Finan: His comments focussed on the state making efforts to promote use of Ohio coal, burning it cleanly and helping companies afford the environmental technologies so they can burn Ohio coal. Speaker Pro Tem Cates: Did not say much other than a coherent energy policy is absolutely necessary. Consumers Counsel Tongren: Took credit for success of municipal aggregation. Wants to work with federal government on energy policy. Laid out questions he has for state and national energy policy. Rob thanked FERC for their work last week on RTOs Allen Hill, CEO of DPL: Said he was very encouraged by FERCs aggressive agenda and that it is important to get RTOs in place and operational as soon as possible. He supports a national energy policy. Says industry needs environmental certainty. Said SB3 will survive b/c it was based on consensus. Ohio needs to finish rules on supplier defaults. Jerry Jordan, President, Ind. Petroleum Producers Assocation: Urged Ohio to stick to the effort of electric restructuring. He reviewed the history of gas restructuring in Ohio and illustrated how the industry evolved and that it took time. Tim Timken, Jr., President National Association of Manufacturer's: Came out strongly in favor of FERC moving forward aggressively on RTOs. Niel Ellerbrook, CEO, Vectren: PUCO should look at monthly GCR adjustments. Tom Catania, VP Govt. Affairs, Whirlpool Corporation: He is member of NAM, US Chamber and Business Roundtable. Very pro-restructuring. Pushed tax credits and exemptions for consumers who purchase energy efficient appliances. Jim Rogers, CEO, Cinergy: Comments focused on supply and demand balance in ECAR. Said major factor that is pushing prices up is environment. Spoke against Sen. Jeffords bill. Environment is Cinergy's biggest priority. Said that Ohio should stay the course on competition. FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell: During our conversation with her, she suggested that we work with Ethan Brown at NGA on the task force with DOE. Chairman Schriber is getting involved in this effort as well. I will work with Sue Landwehr on this. Finally, Governor Taft recently hired a staffer for his Washington office to focus on energy issues. Her name is Sara Sleighter. She used to work for the PUCO and as an aide in the Ohio House. Sara left the PUCO when her husband accepted a position as Rep. Tiber's chief of staff in DC. Sara is very willing to sit down with Enron to talk about our issues. I will contact John Shelk separately to discuss. (Christi -- Sara said you were very helpful to her during the SE RTO mediation -- at that time she worked for APPA's law firm.)

Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional schedule, both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the call. If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled, we expect Armey and Gramm to both be in DC by Monday morning. The numbers are as follows: Senator Gramm (202) 224-2934Majority Leader Armey (202) 225-4000 Here are the talking points ** CONFIDENTIAL ** Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 Background: We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation. On legal certainty, nearly all interested parties agree. However, Senator Gramm continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business. There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and SEC. Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9. Talking Points: We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year. There are very few legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential. Do not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty for this dynamic and growing industry. The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for all physical commodity transactions (not including agricultural commodities) entered into on a counterparty-to-counterparty basis or on an electronic trading facility. We strongly support these provisions. The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges. These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate. Without this legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these platforms will develop overseas. Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have been resolved. We are indifferent to outstanding provisions, except to the extent that they impede passage of the legislation. We cannot allow the great progress made to date, fail in the end. If asked, about a possible solution to the logjam. Answer: Encourage Majority Leader Armey, Senator Gramm, and Secretary Summers to meet immediately to finalize the remaining issues. Given time constraints, if such a meeting does not occur in the next few days, there may not be enough time to pass this important legislation. Note: Congress will be going out on either October 20 or October 27.\nAnswer: Sensitive"

Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should be on your calendars. As a brief update prior to our call: We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the merger. Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of our proceeding. Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case. Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact. Chris is working with some political operatives on this. We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing. As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties. An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23. While RTO progress has been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO). We are working with Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' commitment to join an RTO. There was some question about the status of a temporary services company being created by the merged company. Joanne has been working with the Sierra and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, but I have asked her for confirmation that this \"alternative\" type of service company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding. I am waiting for a response from Joanne. Please let me know if you have any questions. Sarah\nAnswer: sensitive"

The oil belonged to Tosco. We had/have a contract to haul this oil for Tosco and were performing through Cummings. We outsourced our crude oil hauling function in California to Cummings and other companies last year, and many of our former crude drivers went to work for Cummings and these companies. The oil has gone into navigable waters and has reached the Pacific Ocean (during spawning season). This incident is on the front page of today's L.A. Times Metro Section. ACCORDING TO ED ATTANASIO, NEITHER EOTT NOR ENRON IS MENTIONED IN THE TIMES COVERAGE. It is quite possible that Tosco will seek indemnity from us (in connection with this incident) under the terms of our hauling contract with them. The liabilities here for Tosco could be very significant. Ed Attanasio is monitoring this situation closely. We need to be sensitive to this situation for a number of reasons. Someone may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter. Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard. At this juncture, we need to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter. Until further notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty Cunningham . Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver. We should otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further comment at this time. Also, Lori and Molly, we will need to decide very soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate time, we should see what Baird thinks. We will look to Cummings and their insurance carriers to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don't have enough information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may have in this matter. Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and advise on this ASAP. Please advise if there are any questions. Thanks. SWD\nAnswer: sensitive"

SB 28x(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including manyIEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall, two new provisions were addedto the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealingwith both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generatingfacilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decidednot to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provisionremained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to holdtheir opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiateon the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities thatalready have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed uponlanguage which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for thecompletion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority ofthe air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. Theschedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or suchlater date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will bevoted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate forconcurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the followingIEP-sponsored proposals: Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Actrequirements Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CEC Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing powerplant sites Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposedproject. Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agencyreview. Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review processestablished in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals stillon the table include: Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions forpower plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance Giving deference to other state and regional agencies Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good news.The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of newpower plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expeditedpermitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can.Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. Thisissue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC toinclude a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES powerplant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that adeveloper enter into a contract to sell power to specified Californiaentities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEPmembers company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measureregardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments aredefinitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendmentsattempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy ofthe bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language, which clarifies that theAuthority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can befound on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burtonin the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was mostlikely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee toInvestigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigationsinto market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; EricHildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, StateAuditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week andfocused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before thecommittee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on therise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation andcollusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package ofbills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of thecommittee=01,s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up forconsideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of theCalpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for theSan Jose region. The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting sothat construction can begin. -- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week.IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) andwill comment on their provisions as soon as possible. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both thespecial session and regular session.

Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. Assembly leaders, who convened the group, set an ambitious schedule that would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. But the newly formed plan, which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions, remains too rough for a vote, said Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly \"on call\" for the scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal comes in the next three weeks. But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to travel throughout the state and beyond. Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not authorize a plan by then. His spokesman, Steven Maviglio, said Thursday the governor is not ruling out that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative discussions. \"It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus, but they're just not there,\" Maviglio said. \"The governor is optimistic about the Aug. 15 date.\" Even so, Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until lawmakers return Aug. 20.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

In one case, an energy company charged as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, which were imposed June 20. State grid operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy, Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Corp., and Williams Cos. The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California set at $101 per megawatt-hour. Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant, however, asked as much as $540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall, the company's average bid was close to costs, the report said. The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. \"The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,\" he said. \"If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California.\" The Cal-ISO report singled out Duke Energy, noting it \"continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs.\" The report shows the company's cost to produce electricity was between $85 and $121 but it offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. \"The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. ,2001 Associated Press\nAnswer: not sensitive"

My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the \"HC\" or \"Est RT$\" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct. PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to \"collect\" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders. Frank\nAnswer: sensitive"

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate action on energy legislation, and a likely confrontation over whether to allow oil drilling in an Arctic wildlife refuge, is being put off until early next year. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Tuesday he is committed to bringing an energy bill up for floor debate within the first weeks after Congress returns in January. Daschle has said that other pressing matters such as economic recovery, national security in light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and remaining government spending bills, leave no time to deal with energy this year. It is ``not only my expectation, but my commitment that we will take the bill up during that first work period'' next year, meaning before the Senate's recess for Presidents' Day in mid-February. Congress is expected to recess in mid-December and return in January. Senate Republicans have accused Daschle of blocking consideration of energy legislation to avoid a heated debate over development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. A number of Democrats have vowed to filibuster any attempt to open the refuge to oil companies, which has been a key element of President Bush's domestic energy development strategy. ``It's a great concern to me and a number of senators that we are not going to be able to consider energy policy for our country before the end of the year, especially in view of the fact that we see now continuing uncertainty about what is going to be done by OPEC countries,'' said GOP leader Trent Lott of Mississippi. Republicans have argued that legislation is needed to spur domestic energy development and ease U.S. reliance on oil imports including those from the Persian Gulf. Democrats have maintained that most of the provisions in an energy bill will be aimed at long-term measures and should not be rushed through in the final weeks of the session. Amid talk of an energy crisis, the House last summer passed a fairly broad energy bill. But its plans to follow with a series of measures aimed specifically at the electricity industry, a key part of a comprehensive energy blueprint, were sidetracked by the events of Sept. 11. Since then, energy prices across the board from oil and natural gas to gasoline and electric power have declined dramatically with plenty of supplies, easing the crisis atmosphere that prevailed less than a year ago.

The problem is this: Regardless of what the MOU says, we will have to go through a size/probability analysis on this deal. The deal is clearly material to EOTT. From an SEC perspective, the duty to disclose a pending deal depends upon how material the transaction is and how likely it is to occur. If a deal is very material, a lower degree of probability is needed before disclosure is required. The MOU itself is not totally determinative, although signing a document which looks like an LOI will increase the chances of having to disclose. In the present case, if Equilon's Board gives the go- ahead to deal with us exclusively, I feel there would be at least a 20% chance of closing a transaction (based upon past dealings with these folks). Accordingly, if/when that happens, we will need to take a hard look at the disclosure issue. We do not want to disclose prematurely, but I am pretty sure that this deal would be considered \"material,\" and if we go forward with Equilon, I believe that we will need to disclose it at some point prior to closing (certainly after signing a PSA). We can delay disclosure for a period of time for legitimate business reasons, and the MOU we sign may not rise to the level of an LOI, but at some point---if we go forward with Equilon---we are going to reach a point where the size and probability of the deal will mandate disclosure. We don't need to make a decision at this point, we just need to be aware of these circumstances and manage the process accordingly. From a different perspective, we want to sign some kind of LOI with Equilon as soon as we feel comfortable doing so because we want the HSR waiting period to begin running. Equilon wants to close by November 1st. Please advise if you wish to discuss further. Thanks. SWD\nAnswer: sensitive"

If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get organized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, but one thing we should start thinking about now is the \"disclosure\" issue. If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this transaction , Equilon will probably want to sign a memorandum of understanding with us, and this may put us in a \"disclosure\" posture because at that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past dealings with these people). Even without a signed document, the \"size/probability\" test would still be an issue for us to deal with. Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's Board. Thanks.

I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues. If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call. Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract? YES. Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report? YES. Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights? YES. The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights. How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate? The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate. If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's \"negotiated\". Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated. We are not 100% positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.\nAnswer: sensitive"

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE service. The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now. We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU, and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues. We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together. Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar. This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance. We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress. A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me). I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask. If timing is bad for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative. I will follow up with a phone call to you. Hope this helps.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of \"stepping too close to or over the line\". Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me. Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need to be aware of this limited restriction. Sincerely BNG Dan J Hyvl 06/07/2001 04:59 PM\nAnswer: sensitive"

This is what I have experienced when on the Hill and when representing companies either being acquired or doing the merger/acquisition. Our friends on the Hill will wonder where we and they have been, particularly if, as is likely, we may need them later on. Better to get in with them on the ground floor. I know there is a lot going on, but it would be beneficial to the merger approval process to at least have informal contacts starting this week before they leave for Thanksgiving. Thanks for the conference calls to keep us up to date and for being candid in doing so. John\nAnswer: not sensitive"

We appreciate thesuggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontestedsettlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around theelements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer ofSettlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest. Weencourage your active participation in this process. Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conferenceis aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.

The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not \"profiting,\" we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16,000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says \"Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider.\" Our credibility is on the line.

We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16,000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says \"Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider.\" Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action, we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications, and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation, on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward.\nAnswer: sensitive"

It became very apparent that the ISO was primarily responsible for the delay in producing data. The parties complained that they had not received what the ISO had promised. The PX complained that they had received NO reliable data from ISO (it was riddled with errors) and that they were at the same point as at the beginning of the entire proceeding. The PX needs the ISO data in order to commence generating the data that the PX itself needs to produce. In any event, the new, delayed schedule is a positive development. It is noteworthy that we were able to group consideration of refunds issues and offsets to refunds on the same date- October 26 (previously refund testimony was considered first, and testimony related to possible offsets to refunds was considered on a subsequent date). This is very positive since it reduces the chance that the proceeding will be only about refunds and that the offsets issue will be marginalized. Ray Alvarez\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The schedule has moved back about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to produce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on those revised prices. Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due until October 26. In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported that the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order until October 15, 2001. A revised schedule is attached. (To see how it has changed, you can toggle Track Changes | Hightlight on Screen on and off) The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections rather than actual changes to the schedule.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing. I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc). I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids. This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated. Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors. Martin\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

Let me explainwhy. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talkmore about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricingand specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJMimplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatilityand reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, thePJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deemsis out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The factthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-settingsoftware to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhatunfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that thePJM ISO decides what prices it would likefor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is nota transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buythe risk management services that Enron provides. Theonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market isthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control areato meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay theimports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on theEast Coast. This will effectively mean little importsto the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated atthe discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.It effectively kills off the development of risk management atthe wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much lessprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigatedprices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternativeform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reducesprice volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they justget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-serviceregulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-serviceprices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sourcesof benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-sideinvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management. Anecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflectactual conditions in the market (including the extent of market powerexercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for marketparticipants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJMmodel is just way to have a market in name without achieving anysignificant benefits to consumers or energy traders. Frank\nAnswer: sensitive"

It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its \"Est RT$\". If I am right, that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the \"HC\" or \"Est RT$\" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by notbeing one of the \"bad guy\" generators who are actively taking on theprotective order, when we know that at least four generators are producingnothing until their motion is resolved, and one marketer (Coral/ShellEnergy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to mostof the document request.

Given the recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political fights that are going the wrong way), I was wondering if it made sense to bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to analyze the implications of our development plans. My primary worry is that P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being internalized into the transaction. I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason.

If you or any others intend to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible. The election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final decisions on media spending. Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying firm in Nashville. The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office materials, etc...). Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a stringent campaign finance law. The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up to the business units with interests in Tennessee. If you need further information or would like to discuss this, you can reach me at 614-760-7472 or 614-306-4359 (cell). ---------------------- Forwarded by Barbara A Hueter/DUB/EES on 10/18/2000 01:45 PM ---------------------------\nAnswer: sensitive"

As I have mentioned to you, Enron has been referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators. Also, Lt. Gov. Wilder's campaign chairman called me in the latter part of last week, hoping for significant financial help for end-of-campaign TV buys. Gif Thornton, Robert Gowan, and I are participating heavily; I cannot overemphasize the importance of Enron's participation. The state \"money crunch\" which existed this past year likely will be worse when the General Assembly reconvenes (tax collections are coming in below estimates), and all existing tax exemptions will be at significant risk. Please do what you can to get some Enron assistance for the candidates which we have discussed now. Thanks. Bill William R.

I wouldlike to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries. As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you. In discussingpower markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, itseems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the\"forgotten resource\" in more efficient power markets. There seems to be alot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that manyresearchers need to address some practical but important problems. I wasasked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and giveit the visibility that would have it considered more seriously bypolicymakers. Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure auseful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a majorsponsor. I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enronthat the company might consider providing $25,000. As you may appreciate,it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of theconference is widely circulated among key government groups. I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas andrecommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) toparticipate. I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron ofproviding funding for this effort. Thank you,Hill Huntington - retail notes.rtf*******************************************************************Hillard G.

SB 28x(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including manyIEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall, two new provisions were addedto the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealingwith both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generatingfacilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decidednot to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provisionremained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to holdtheir opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiateon the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities thatalready have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed uponlanguage which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for thecompletion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority ofthe air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. Theschedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or suchlater date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will bevoted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate forconcurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the followingIEP-sponsored proposals: Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Actrequirements Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CEC Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing powerplant sites Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposedproject. Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agencyreview. Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review processestablished in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals stillon the table include: Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions forpower plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance Giving deference to other state and regional agencies Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good news.The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of newpower plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expeditedpermitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can.Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. Thisissue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC toinclude a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES powerplant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that adeveloper enter into a contract to sell power to specified Californiaentities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEPmembers company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measureregardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments aredefinitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendmentsattempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy ofthe bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language, which clarifies that theAuthority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can befound on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burtonin the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was mostlikely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee toInvestigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigationsinto market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; EricHildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, StateAuditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week andfocused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before thecommittee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on therise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation andcollusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package ofbills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of thecommittee=01,s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up forconsideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of theCalpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for theSan Jose region. The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting sothat construction can begin. -- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week.IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) andwill comment on their provisions as soon as possible. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both thespecial session and regular session.

It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire. I am not really familiar with the specific facts here. The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees. So, if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a supervisor. Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel. If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced. It is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other alternative). Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers. I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion. So, let's try to discuss it. I am booked until about 11 this morning, but am available after that.

This is where an agency employee claims that he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak). Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would have to defend it. I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can advise us on the position we should take. I would think that if we single out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee). Michelle, can you help us with this one? Thanks. Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . . . Enron Europe\nAnswer: sensitive"

We discussed how the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are infact agency workers. Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get applicable benefits. The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff. He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly \"muddied the water\" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or the agency. He was not involved with the original decision to grant these employees Share Options. We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy thing to do. However, this is his ideal scenario. How viable is it that we can do this for him? He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees. Regards Melissa\nAnswer: sensitive"

I shall forward your comments to Greg. I agree with you that it's in the best interest of Enron and of the industryto invest in education of the public regarding the benefits that free energy markets produce for the society. What I don't understand is that this message has to be repeated over and over again,given all the evidence that the economic history of the 20th century produced. The problem is that it's a long-term effort that requires a lot of patience anda significant investment of time and human capital. I think that the academic communitycan play an important role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic ofderegulation process. Vince\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I can't tell you how many reporters have called and asked me to commenton all of the \"terrible\" things Enron has done. I then have to explain tothem howmarkets work and debunk all of these \"terrible\" things.I'm probably very naive, but I think just explaining to investors how thesemarketswork would add value to Enron's stock, because people would then see theeconomic sense in many of things it is doing. I'll stop pestering you and Greg about this, but I'm very concernedthat youmay win the battle for competitive energy markets, but lose the war becausethe public at large doesn't see where or how they can benefit from Enron'smarket-making innovations. Frank SEP 09, 2001A Self-Inflicted Wound Aggravates Angst Over EnronBy ALEX BERENSON Something is rotten with the state of Enron.Or so Wall Street suspects. On Jan. 1, shares in Enron (news/quote), thegiant energy trading company in Houston, stood at $83.13. On Friday, Enronclosed at $31.57, down 9.7 percent for the week and 62 percent for theyear. The slide has destroyed more than $38 billion in shareholder value.In part, the company's problems are beyond its control, a result of thecollapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a comingglut in electricity. But the deepest wound at Enron is self-inflicted.Heavy insider selling, indecipherable accounting practices and a stream ofexecutive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gapbetween the company and Wall Street.\"The stock is trading under a cloud,\" says James S. Chanos, the presidentof Kynikos Associates, a hedge fund in New York. Mr. Chanos began bettingagainst Enron early this year and says he thinks that the company's sharesremain overvalued.Enron's problems came to a head on Aug. 14, when it announced that JeffreyK. Skilling, the chief executive, had quit for personal reasons.With his resignation, Mr. Skilling joined a half-dozen other top Enronmanagers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities. Still,the news came as a surprise because Mr. Skilling was named to his post onlyin February.Under the best of circumstances, the unexpected departure of a chiefexecutive rattles Wall Street. But hard-headed investors can usuallycomfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearlydeparted pooh-bah has left behind. Executives come and go, but numbers areforever.Unfortunately, Enron's books offer investors little succor. The complexityof the company's businesses and the way it reports its results makeunderstanding Enron's financial statements essentially impossible.Over the last decade, Enron has transformed itself from a simple naturalgas pipeline company into the world's largest trader of electricity andgas. Last year, about three-quarters of the company's cash flow came out ofthe company's wholesale services division, which includes its tradingoperations.But Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes. Are theyshort-term or long-term? Is the company hedged, or does it make\"directional bets\" on the prices of the commodities it trades?The answers are crucial, because they determine how much risk Enron hastaken to make its money. Big profits are nice. Big profits that come frombig, risky trades are a recipe for big, unexpected write-offs.Enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closelyrelated companies in \"related party\" transactions. The company says thatthe deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and thatthey have been approved by its board and outside auditors.But related-party deals can provide a convenient way for public companiesto shift losses to private affiliates. And Enron's disclosure about itsrelated-party deals, including billions of dollars in asset swaps with apartnership that until recently was controlled by the company's chieffinancial officer, is notably sketchy.In the good old days, like last year, companies could get away with theunlikeliest of accounting gimmicks, as long as their revenue and profitnumbers looked good. But Wall Street has become more demanding, as Enron islearning to its chagrin.Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, says the company is aware of investors'concerns. \"We've got credibility issues on the street, no question,\" Mr.Palmer says. \"We're looking at a lot of ways to give our investors moreinformation.\"Sooner would be better than later.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

For the speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of energy development. Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the commission is charged with the development and promotion of such. But the Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters in the traditional sense. We will continue to have the status of a colony if we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are evolving. If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role in this evolution. I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a short Qand A period. But your message can be as succint as you can make it and get the point across. You may have to present the Enron case a number of different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point. You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address role playing by the state and the commission. Plan to join us for lunch. If you need more detail, let me know. Thanks!

Just wondering what it means to possibly add a provision, which I understand is a \"may\" -- dealing with FERC's authority to change existing RTOs. Depending on what that means, it could seriously hamstring FERC's efforts for a 4-5 RTO model as sought and we support, by not letting FERC change \"existing RTOs\" (particularly if that includes pending, but not approved) to change. For example, would the language under consideration block a Northeast RTO of PJM, NY and NE since PJM is \"existing\" and NY has filed? What would be the rationale for such a serious limitation on FERC's authority? Thanks.\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

Classify text among sensitive, not sensitive.\n\n---\n\nFollow the following format.\n\nQuestion: ${question}\nAnswer: The classification label, either 'sensitive' or 'not sensitive'.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: FYI - It sounds like this consultant's findings are being questioned by many in the industry, including by the CAISO. Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity NeedsDan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif. ( October 17, 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate \"power emergencies\" because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors emissions. \"We are seeing a lot of under-generation,\" McCullough said. \"This is market power in action.\" Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies, including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. \"That can't possibly be right,\" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. \"In North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). \"Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, I can't comment,\" Lloyd said. \"We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,\" he said. \"We don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high.\" Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states, British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. \"EPA data is notoriously unreliable,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. \"Greed would get the best of anybody,\" Wolak said. \"I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out.\" Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading companies. \"If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,\" Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled \"proprietary\" by companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets. \"Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally?\" Belden said. \"California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody understands,\" he said. \"If you've got nothing to hide, release the data.\" ----- To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com(c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file. Here's why: - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule on market-based rate eligibility. - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up reasons. I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we know they don't care about. I think the real reason is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the new rule comes out. - - No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable to get kicked out, too. They might not want to give MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new rule. - - The best way to deal with that is to sit down with staff, go over the draft page by page, and see what more they want. But that would take too long, because of staff's schedule. - - The second best way is for me to call Dan Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if that's good enough. If he suggests different language, we'll have to put it in there. - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this through without saying anything to FERC in advance, we can file it, and just hope that the language we have about complying with the new rule is good enough. But that's really not what I would recommend. If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today. If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. 2. I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows. Good luck, and I'll talk to you soon. >>> \"Nettelton, Marcus\" <Marcus.Nettelton@ENRON.com> 10/30/01 09:35AM >>>Catherine Attached is a mark up of suggested changes to the filing as per myvoicemail earlier this morning.In addition we will need to confirm whether Sandhills is a subsidiary ofEnron Corp.We will be adding two contacts from our Regulatory Group.

We are working on adding headers to therate schedule and code of conduct. Thank you for the information on New Albany. I removed all referencesto New Albany because we recently worked with Susan, Stuart and Roberton that transaction. Also we removed the references to five otherpeakers Enron sold recently - we worked with Stuart to get those FERCapprovals. In addition, we did not include a reference to NorthCarolina Power Holdings, L.L.C. made in earlier filings. We are awarethat Enron received 203 authorization to sell that entity earlier thisyear. We am uncertain about whether that transaction closed but weassumed it did and removed it but need to confirm with you that it isappropriate to remove it. Thank you for the suggestion about updating the information from thetriennial filing. We will certainly double check to make sure thecompanies we have listed in the attached draft have not been sold.Also, we refer to exhibit 2 to the triennial filing made on January 14,2000 rather than listing the names of Enron's generating units withmarket-based rate authorization whose output is dedicated underlong-term contracts.

Last Friday Mr Ohta, President of Chubu Electric and Chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, made some uninformed comments at a regular energy press club briefing about Enron's commitment to its Californian customers . Ohta will be retiring from both positions in two weeks. In the past both Chubu Electric and the Federation of Electric Power Companies have distanced themselves from Mr Ohta's public comments which are generally considered to be ultra conservative and unsupported by facts. As a result, we have tended to ignore his comments. However, on this occasion I think we need to set the record straight on Enron's role in California. I would welcome your thoughts on whether we should let the comments pass or respond. Over the past few months we have received various statements from Houston (for both internal and external consumption) explaining Enron's role in California. Most recently (May 10) we received from Peggy Mahoney (via Vance) an EES statement dated 1 February entitled \"Media Statement about EES Resourcing California Customers\". It would be helpful if there is a comprehensive statement that has recently been put together that we could distribute here. If not, we can put something together here tomorrow and email it across to you for approval, with the aim of getting something out Wednesday. As an aside, we had a record 3,766 visitors to the EJ website last Friday, the day the Brattle paper appeared on the website. kind regards ---------------------- Forwarded by Nicholas O'Day/AP/Enron on 05/21/2001 05:38 PM ---------------------------\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I spoke with Governor Geringer's staff person again this past week and was hoping that Paul Kaufman could be the senior executive, but no such luck (unless you give Paul a huge new title!). In talking with Maureen I understand that you have a previous conflict Steve, but I am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an adjustment in order to meet the request of the Governor.

Electricity provisions are in Division B that starts on page 2 of the summary. I also have the 70 pages of legislative language for electricity issues, which I have started to review. As noted below, there are certain issues we will want to read very carefully on the legislative language. Highlights -- 1. FERC has jurisdiction over transmission component of retail sales.2. FERC may order transmitting utilities to join RTOs.3. FERC jurisdiction extended to munis, coops and federal utilities.4. Reliability section is actually better than the summary sounds. The summary says FERC will defer to NERC. The actual legislative language in a page or so only, says FERC shall handle reliability and MAY defer to NERC or to RTOs.5. FERC may order a generating utility that is found to have market power to submit a mitigation plan.6. On market transparency (THIS ONE WE NEED TO READY VERY CAREFULLY), FERC is to establish an electronic system for real time information on wholesale and transmission services, including prices. The text appears broader thatn the Wyden-Burns bill we support. The impact on EOL and ENA needs to be assessed ASAP. I will fax this language shortly.7. PUHCA and PURPA repeal.8. Increases BPA borrowing -- but subject to appropriations -- which may undermine it.9. Real time pricing and net metering.10. FERC may allow market-based rates but only if the seller does not market power and sells into a competitive market.(NEED GUIDANCE ON ENA AND EOL IMPACT HERE, TOO. Will include legislative language in fax.11. Refund effective date under Federal Power Act is changed to date of filing of complaint.12. Interconnection standards.\nAnswer: sensitive"

We then met up with GM on the Friday. Basically GM Petroleos (the main GM company) has entered into the Spanish equivalent of U.S. Ch.11. We have still not seen a copy of the petition presented to the Court, but this shd be forthcoming in the next day or so. The idea behind the petition for suspension of payments is to help companies that are facing liquidity problems. GM wd certainly fit that bill, although it remains doubtful as to whether GM can claim that its assets exceed its liabilities. The effect of the petition is to provide a moratorium on the repayment of any unsecured creditors, and on any judgments which those creditors obtain. The petition does not however prevent any preferred or secured creditors from enforcing their debts (in the latter case, to the extent of their security). The judge to whom the petition is presented appoints 3 administrators. 2 are appointed from a list of accountants that the court maintains, and the third (also appointed by the court) is a representative of one of the top third of the list of creditors. Once the administrators are appointed, the financial control of GMP will be their responsibility. They will authorize any future transactions, draw up the definitive list of creditors, and examine the solvency or otherwise of the company. In due course they will submit a report to the judge advising as to whether the company is insolvent or not. If insolvent, the Court will request that GMP provide a warranty for the difference between the amount owed and the assets. If this is not met within 14 days, subsidiary proceedings may be started to examine any personal liability of the management. Parallel with this, the administrators will be speaking to all the creditors with a view to reaching an inter creditor arrangement on repayment of an agreed level of debt. Even though secured creditors are not precluded in enforcing their security during the suspension of payments procedure, it is usual for them too to take part in these discussions. The outside lawyers seemed to think that the amount contained in the petition is equivalent to USD 85 million. We have no real idea how this is broken down, but the following shd be a rough guide: VAT authority - USD 25 millionVeba - USD 15 millionEnron - USD 5 millionTotal - USD 3millionBank debt - USD 22 million - balance USD15 million The Spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure may be difficult to prove as a debt. This exposure arises from the market difference we agreed to sell Dec. shipments to GMP (which then cd not put up the agreed purchase price to ensure delivery) and the current market price. Chris can confirm what these losses are today. We wd have to sue on those agreements (English arbitration), and then present to the administrators the arbitration judgments. However, as the administrators report is usually ready within 2-3months, I suspect that leaving aside any other factors there may be a timing problem here. The Spanish lawyers said that GMP Board may have some personal liability issues. The Board is supposed to call a shareholders meeting if the company is in financial difficulties. Moreover, if there has been stripping out of assets from GMP, then those responsible may face criminal sanction On the issue of preferences, it wd appear that Spanish law is somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand there is old jurisprudence to the effect that any and all transactions entered into by the debtor before its insolvency can be challenged by the administrators, irrespective of whether those transactions wd constitute a preference. On the other hand there is jurisprudence of equivalent weight which states that this is not the case, and that only preferences may be challenged. The Spanish lawyers were not able to say which system wd apply in the current scenario, but their insolvency lawyer made the following points: there was no immediate threat from anyone against Enron or ECTRIC Spain. The whole issue about preferences is not dealt with until the report by the administrators is made to the judge. There is no chance of any nasty shocks like injunctions on Arcos etc.the payment to Enron of USD50 million at the same time as the VAT authorities were not being paid shd not overly worry Enron at the moment, as such payments are unlikely to be seen as a preference.most companies (even those judged insolvent) end up being dissolved voluntarily, probably as a result of the uncertainty of Spanish insolvency law. If a voluntary arrangement is reached it is unlikely to provide for anything but the most obvious preference (and the transfer of the strategic oil from GM to ECTRIC Spain wd not fall within this category)The VAT authorities (probably the main creditor) are not pro active in these sorts of proceedings and tend to take a back seat For what t is worth, GM made the following points: GM's banks' inability to fund further prompted GMP management to make the petition (this despite the fact that GM had previously assured Enron that the GMP bank debt was minimal)petition is for Pta 10 billionGM lawyer said shd have made decision earlier to present the petitionGM lawyer also said that GMP had made what he called \"third party financing\" of Pta 6 billion, and accepted my suggestion that the administrators wd be asking for such funds back GMP wd be willing to put up Don Antonio's assets to secure Enron's continuing supplies to it (we have heard that many times before). Without such supplies GM stated that GMP was insolvent. They were not able to provide a reason as to why such assets cd not be pledged beforehandGMP sees Enron as the \"key\", namely that the supplies if resumed wd trigger the payment to GM of its outstanding receivables. GM wants Enron to meet with the administrators next week. It is early days but I wd suggest the following: unlikely the old man's assets will be forthcominglikley the company will go into insolvencylikley the creditors will reach a voluntary arrangementtherefore unlikely there will be any clawback of earlier payments/strategic storage oilequally, unlikely Enron will receive any recognition of its MTM debt Chris, let me know if there is anything you wd like to add/clarify. otherwise once we get the petition we will advise further. tks\nAnswer: sensitive"

The rates are not much lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates. The tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into effect by the Supreme Decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down. The deliverables here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2) file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology. This second deliverable has now been completed. Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that Transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about 5 minutes! This ruling should also significantly increase Transredes's market value, relative to Enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company. ---------------------- Forwarded by Ray Alvarez/NA/Enron on 05/14/2001 11:38 AM --------------------------- Doug Farmer05/11/2001 06:09 PM\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The details are :- Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB % Increase Gas Export (including surcharges) $0.18 $0.2205 22.5% $0.26 (excluding RG) 44.4%Liquids Domestic $1.05 $2.46 134.3% $3.25 209.5%Liquids Export $1.55 $2.31 49% $3.35 116.1% CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19 $2.20 84.9% $3.528 196.5% As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our liquids domestic) !! We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :- 1. Export gas volumes increased to 100% TR capacity, and 100% GSA + Cuiaba 2 assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes2. RG Compresion project deleted3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions7. OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004.8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30 Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :- 1. Volumes. Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back here. Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term i.e. 2002/2003.2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the support of BG3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used. When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited.4. Liquids Expansion in the South. Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production will be shut in. If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco). We will then write to those producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE. We will give them an estimate of the lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from this decision. We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal.5. Continuity of Service Capex. We need to see the detail here. We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards. We need to see exactly what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision. Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process.6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday.7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy.8. Debt/Equity ratio. Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 40%. However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 100% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 60/40. We intend to fight this one very hard using all the external/independant help we can get. As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut. This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases. Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases. Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions (i.e. the worst case).

David and I discussed this option which he is in favor of it as well. In the meantime for year end we will be ready with a system change to allow us to see pt/rh employees on the screen segregated from the full timers- and to have a live chart of pt/rh employees as well as the full timers. We can't do that for mid-year because it requires a good deal of programming, but it is a feature we can incorporate at year end. what do you think? Gina\nAnswer: not sensitive"

This bill may or may not be subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this summer. Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise. The call to Barton was to: a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit for the defeat of price caps. I hear from lots of DC sources that we have not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Numerous folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's first real role in the Committee. Thus, even though this is a very limited bill, the call made sense. I do not think that this means we should call the White House to push the bill with them. The bill itself still has lots of obstacles and many potential threats ahead.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

As most of you will by now know, probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. In fact, Enron's credit trading will, as you know, rely strictly on publicly available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential information, unless the reference entity has specifically consented. Nevertheless, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote prices on such entities.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

In this case, FERC stated that \"a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . .\" and specifically rejected the use of a \"trial-type evidentiary hearing.\" Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate \"paper\" hearings with \"trial-type\" hearings; see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>>Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh.

My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected. It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \"fault\" for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points. Whoever is blamed might not really matter. My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West. This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets. Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets. Commissioner Massey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done. FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity and intrastate take away capacity (which, by the way, doesn't appear to address storage). Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport costs.

Gas prices were controversial. Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it was less than a dollar in other areas. He then noted that the high gas cost would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must act regarding the high transport differentials- \"We will never get a handle on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices\". That opened the floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner Breathitt of FERC's technical conference (notice of which issued today) on the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy of infrastructure within CA. She said that this would shed light on basis differentials and gas prices. Freudian slip? Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall below 7%). Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen. Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., Stages 1, 2 or 3): Hebert opined \"Most of the time\". Breathitt said \"Likely 80-85% of the time\". Massey was unconvinced. Several Senators railed at the Commission for \"not doing its job\" and threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act. If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free to call.

Classify text among sensitive, not sensitive.\n\n---\n\nFollow the following format.\n\nQuestion: ${question}\nAnswer: The classification label, either 'sensitive' or 'not sensitive'.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western Electric Situation I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today. House hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality). Senate hearing was on last week's FERC order on a \"soft price cap\" and related issues. The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation Implementation Task Force. In addition, there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA. The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners. HIghlights Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region to support sec. 102.Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could be done; the witnesses just said \"cost plus a reasonable profit\" and said leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last week's soft price cap is much better.Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR) got the Cal Energy Comm chair to admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken recently. The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \"help is on the way\" in the form of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat contentious at times.

First, I apologize for my prolonged recent absences. I have had twolong-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on \"final review\"- a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted forpublication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference(topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the publicaffairs function). In order to get it done properly, I need to forego anywork at Enron until later in the month. A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also haveinterest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. Johntold me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of themethodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that governmentaffairs brings - especially in a system where, for example, on thelegislative side, much of the \"work\" of government affairs is to blocklegislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs tojustify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefitsof the function are important to quantify. I'd like to review any of theprevious work and make suggestions as necessary. At some point, let me know how you would like to proceed. Otherwise, I hope all is well with you all. Cordially, Doug\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline: http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures.

We currently have Ken scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne, Hull, Geringer and Ridge. (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session). Kaufman and I thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him. I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening (6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some sections of the RGA events. I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning. If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit. Paul and I will cover the RGA events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime in the near future. Same with Rowe. Rosalee Fleming 04/27/2001 07:12 PM\nAnswer: not sensitive"

She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a lot of CEOs. I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3. I transferred her to Sherri and called Ken. Ken wanted me to try to get more specific information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant. She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend. Ken said to let you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it. He said one thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in L.A. on May 2. Talk to you Monday. Rosie\nAnswer: sensitive"

Enron currently has a gas compressor on site and we own the land. We are seeking to deliver the power to markets in the west. This will serve the Palo Verde region. Jim Steffes has beenadvising as to the local permitting processes. I will keep you in the loop as we proceed.

He is offering to get us access to Andrew Lundquist (I said staffer preciously, but we now know he is Chairman of the President's Energy Task force). He also thinks he can get us in to top levels of the Energy Department, and the White House (we think he is talking about Carl Rove - who was G.W.'s Campaign Manager and is now a senior White House Counsel).For this service, he wants $10,000 plus direct expenses. If unsuccessful in at least getting us into Lundquist, he will not charge anything. We think it's a worthwhile shot. Could Duke and/or Enron agree to split the expense with us? Also, it will be imperative that all of us, whether paying or not, be represented at whatever meetings are arranged.Please advise. Regards,Steve Crain\nAnswer: sensitive"

I have arranged for box lunches to be served after the meeting. After the meeting, we will have the remainder of the day for some fun activities, along with a buffet dinner served that evening to complete the day (on-site dinner location TBD). Block of Rooms - A block of rooms have been reserved for Government Affairs. I will be turning in a rooming list to the hotel next week so, I would like to know by Friday, April 27 your plans to attend the meeting. Shuttle Service - See attachment for shuttle times. Please note, a return reservation from the hotel to the airport is required. Please contact the Concierge to arrange for shuttle service. Colorado Weather - For the month of June, you can expect the following: High's - 80.............Low's - 52 Flights from Houston - I have checked with TAP for roundtrip flights from Houston - Denver, Denver - Houston and an exceptionally great (non-refundable) fare of $190.94 is available. However, fares are not guaranteed until actually booked. Let's book early!!!!! The activities to choose from are as follows: Please let me know by May 4 your choice of activity!!!!!! Whitewater Rafting - A bus will leave the Omni Interlocken Resort at 2:00pm to head for an afternoon of exciting adventure on Colorado's Clear Creek. The Arkansas River is one of the most popular whitewater adventures anywhere, combining spectacular scenery and action packed rapids. Teamwork is the name of the game as your team paddles down these tumbling cascades. Continuous class III and IV rapids will thrill guests throughout the run. Drop over Nomad, surge through the Phoenix Holes and take on the class IV climax, the Outer Limits. Good physical condition and the ability to swim are recommended. The group will have three thrilling hours on the river and will return to the Omni by 6:15pm. Chautauqua Park Hiking Adventure - One of the most popular access points for mountain hiking trails in Boulder is Chautauqua Park. The focal point is the 100-year-old dining hall. The Colorado Chautauqua is one of only four of the original Chautauquas still operating in America, as opposed to when thousands dotted the nation and culturally enriched rural people in the early 1900s. The tour includes: transportation, professional guide service, two hours of guided hiking - total time for excursion is 4 hours. (Dress code: Shorts or hiking attire, appropriate footwear, sunglasses, sunscreen and hats). Departure time and return will be relayed at a later date. Spa Services - The Spa at Omni Interlocken Resort offers a number of spa services (massages, facial & skin care treatments, body treatments or nail services, to name a few). If you are interested in this as an activity, please let me know and I will fax a detailed list of their services. You will need to call the spa and schedule your own appointment if this is the activity you choose. Golf - For the golf enthusiasts, an afternoon of golf at the Omni Interlocken 27-hole championship golf course which stretches out over 300 acres of verdant fairways is another activity to select from. Spectacular panoramic views from three 9-hole courses, which feature more than 400 feet in elevation changes. If this is the activity of choice please respond via e:mail and I will add you to the list. The game of choice will be \"best ball\" play. Biking - Scenic bike paths are located near the hotel for those with interest. If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will reserve a bike and map for you enjoyment. After reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to take part in. Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it more difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask that you not change your selection. So, please talk to your colleagues ahead of time before making your choice. Thanks and don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.

All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market. During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M. The gas cost will be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?). The gas cost and emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day. A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators. Highest bid sets the clearing price. Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit. The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs. In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price. FERC has 60 days to review/act. No opportunity costs in real time. Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost. However, credit sleeves are permissible. Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids. FERC is attempting to break the demand curve. (24-7) Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance. RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 or Order lapses with no further effect. ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built. Comments are due in 15 days. Quarterly reports thereafter. Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior. Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior. An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate. In addition, \"hockey stick\" bids are expressly prohibited (i.e. bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level). Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California. Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7%. Control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs. Apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified. All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within WSCC. FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California. Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations. The refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the Order. Nox Limits in California -- Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law. However, it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part of the price bid. Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price. Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the PG&E bankruptcy filing. No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from California. The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order. We will keep you posted. RA\nAnswer: sensitive"

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants). Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing. Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day. Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices. Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic. It's attached. Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics. Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling. Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Thecurrent challenges are keeping company's management busy. Being aware ofthis I wanted to take liberty of asking, if it would be possible to getsomeone of Enron's top executive to contribute Nokia's top executivedevelopment program. We have invited a few external key note speakers toelaborate their company's transformation. This kind of experience change hasproved to be beneficial for both parties. Also Nokia's experiences have beenvaluable input in certain restructuring processes. This program, called Panorama, is an annual top executive developmentprogram, which takes about half a year in three modules. In every year wehave nominated 35 participants to this intensive action. The program targetis three folded, give input to company's strategy development, strengthenand integrate common understanding of company's direction, and developleadership capacity. The program owner is Jorma Ollila, CEO of Nokia. What are benefits from Enron's point of view in the case we are able to getsomeone of Enron's executives in the program? I think that one of the mostimportant outcome of this kind of events is to open a dynamic networkingand discussion forum between our executives. Both parties could capitalizethis cooperation. In short, we would appreciate very much if we could have your company'spresentation in this Panorama forum.

Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS. The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register. If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals) Two (2) negotiators - Contract ManagersTwo (2) analystsTwo (2) contract administrators The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC: iBuyit SystemCatalog system (part of iBuyit)iPayit system We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department. This would take very few staff adds to make that happen. Let me know if you need any further detail. Morris (713) 503-1409\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I am less certain about the direction FERC will go on pricing, since even the staff has recognized stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants. The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet, so it is unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term. If they try to do so without FERC approval, possible legal avenues might include the filing of a complaint at FERC, asking for fast track processing (this \"fast\" is measured in weeks, not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in court (faster), which can be hard to obtain but not impossible, depending entirely on the circumstances.

I am less certain about the direction FERC will go on pricing, since even the staff has recognized stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants. The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet, so it is unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term. If they try to do so without FERC approval, possible legal avenues might include the filing of a complaint at FERC, asking for fast track processing (this \"fast\" is measured in weeks, not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in court (faster), which can be hard to obtain but not impossible, depending entirely on the circumstances. Will keep you posted if I learn anything new on this. Ray\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Your communications are always complete, firm, clear and polite. I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end. I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway. I have asked John to lead the effort, to the extent you need him. John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office. Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question. It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs. A little background I'll bore you with: after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function. Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups. When Andre left, we reduced the corporate function to a \"default provider\" role -- if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) would help identify competent resources in the area. With the reorganization of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled (led by John Brindle). John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week. I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did. It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation. John volunteered to send some people over to help and I said OK. He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston). The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying \"we're from corporate and we're here to help\". If you don't need any \"help\" or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me know.\nAnswer: sensitive"

We are using several parts of your team, and are very pleased with most. I want to mention a couple of areas, HR and Security. 1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20 hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR, and Drew had his team there for us. 2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team on the ground, and John has provided leadership and all coordination with Houston. Great efforts and productive work. 3. Security: This area has not worked as well, and if you ever want feedback on our one-time experience with this group, I will provide it. I don't have any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night, and Mike has informed us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate with that person. On a side note, the people who have really been helpful were brought in through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he would come. At Mike's earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill & Associates to help on security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates, removing (in a lowkey yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from servers, desktops and laptops. In addition, she has coordinated security for all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony Duenner of EBS Asia. Again, we appreciate all the help. Wade\nAnswer: sensitive"

In the alternative, they would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer subject to an appropriate protective order. Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC request for public information. DENA argues that only a three month lag in the release of confidential information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.Only specifically named \"reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review the information.The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate. Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited commission action. NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory commissions and not other participants. NUSCO and Select Energy request expedited action due the financial implications and there is also considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending Commission guidance.\nAnswer: The classification label for this text is 'not sensitive"

Dedication of Power =01) Edison International will commit the entire output of Sunrise (one of Edison International=01,s non-regulated generating facilities) to the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years. Phase I of Sunrise is to be brought online by August 15, 2001. If not brought online by August 15, 2001, Edison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty. Transmission Sale =01) SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets), subject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion gain on sale, will be used to reduce SCE=01,s net undercollected amount as of January 31, 2001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certain liabilities associated with the transmission assets. Backup Transaction =01) If the transmission sale does not occur within two years for reasons beyond the parties=01, control, then if the State elects, SCE shall sell to the State SCE=01,s hydro generation assets. If the hydro assets are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after December 31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall. Conservation Property =01) SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easements to the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroelectric related lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related lands. Some of the land may be deeded in fee. Contribution by Edison International =01) Edison International will refund to SCE not less than $400 million. This money will consist of a refund of approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus approximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings. Investment =01) Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3 billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE. Litigation =01) SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings and filed rate doctrine cases. CPUC Regulation =01) CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical principles of ratemaking. Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off =01) SCE shall pay an amount that represents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1, 2001 that is attributable to QF=01,s not selling to SCE (due to SCE=01,s failure to pay the QF=01,s). SCE will securitize this amount. Securitization =01) SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amount (approx. $3.5 billion). The securitization shall occur in two tranches (i.e. two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components). The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected amount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the net undercollected amount. The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not occur within two years. Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up in rates for two years, if at all. Buying the Net Short =01) The State will be required to buy the net short through December 31, 2002. After 2002 SCE will be responsible for covering the net short. Investment Recovery =01) SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that will not drop below its current rte (11.6%) during the 10 year cost of service ratemaking period. Next Steps (Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action): Definitive Agreements =01) Once the MOU is signed, the next stage is to negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the transmission sale, as well as the specific terms of the various other related agreements (e.g., the O&M Agreement, Transmission Services Agreement and the Facilities Services Agreement). CPUC Action =01) Prior to entering into the definitive agreements, the CPUC must undertake certain actions (which include: establishing mechanisms for preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs, deferring SCE=01,s general rate case until 2003, granting SCE some relief from direct access credits and clarifying the first priority condition in the holding company act).\nAnswer: not sensitive"

In the Senate:The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.Burton announced during one of the two \"informational\" hearings that \"this is it,\" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.The key features of the bill are:Banks and QFs get paid in full.Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliersNo direct access.There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly:The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).We're attempting to get the \"July 12\" date changed to \"the effective date of the bill\" or later.The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem:The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a \"fair\" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting. That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short, little has changed since yesterday. Best,Jeff\nAnswer: sensitive"

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect. What happened to the one we were discussing earlier? The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers. Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response. The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one. Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over. Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves. These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia. A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN. With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats. FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media. FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota. This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets. Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up. On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended? Please let me know how I can help you. Regards, Mike Hicks\nAnswer: sensitive"

Especially if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron) they take home every night and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well. Since Enron has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion. I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line. How can we (\"Enron\") be a world leading company if we don't have leading world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own. I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding expenses such as these. Just because a person is an executive of the company why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can? Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.

The Dems, of course, love to get this sort of thing going, as itenables them to hold hearings on the need for further legislation tore-regulate. The fact that this President's father came to the White Housein the denouement of a multi-billion dollar savings and loan crisis which hedid not create is also usually forgotten. As I said in my voicemail and as the attached article confirms, I thinkthere is no substance to the rumor that Sen. Gramm would be opposed to mynomination.

I have asked Paul Portney to review \"the lay of the land\" in the environmental policy area.4. Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on this subject.5. I couldn't get anyone on the \"monopoly-too-big-and-powerful\" question, although I am still trying.I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply picture.

It states that rich countrieson average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have stagering entry costs causedby corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays. These \"entry hurdles\" and asscoiated costsdo not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the environment. We might want to make the analogy of \"entry tax\" for new deregulated gas & power markets. Things likenegotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition.Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what they are going to get) and clearly slowsthe new comers down.

Recall that we tried to negotiate a settlement with insurers for some time and then UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration because of the threat of a bad faith claim. I think I summarized it earlier for you, but essentially we now have the choice of pursuing litigation in London against insurers since United India has now sued us in London Court (in addition to arbitration because they figured out a little late that under the policy, only quantum may be arbitrated and they don't want to admit liability). Our option before was only to sue them in India which really isn't an option which is why we agreed to arbitration. Basically UI can't decide what it wants to do, but this memo from Linklaters sets forth DPC's options which Justin, Ken Blades and I discussed regarding the pros and cons of litigation v arbitration. It's a complex mess and I'll be glad to sit down and explain it to you (or not), but we are basically writing to UI's counsel to try and determine what their position is and then we'll decide whether to litigate or arbitrate. Part of this relates to the adjuster's agreement with Ken as to the quantum owed upon a determination of liability. This is all very strange, but nothing regarding India or DPC surprises me anymore. We'll talk about it when you have time, but I just want you to know I'm taking care of this--let me know how involved you want to be (or not...).Just FYI,mb---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 01/03/2000 05:22 PM ---------------------------\nAnswer: not sensitive"

For the benefit of those who were not on the call, I'd like to recap wherethings stand at this point. My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone'sposition. NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement. ECAR has stated itwill sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March 30. SPP isprepared to sign the agreement, but doesn't want to be the only one it itspart of the Eastern Interconnection to do so. FRCC was not on the call,but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at leastsix regions sign. MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to developtheir program with their own members before they sign the NERCagreement. WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting inearly April. SERC has the matter under consideration. I have not heardfrom MAAC, but it has a meeting scheduling for March 29. I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington. In thepast few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people onCapitol Hill and in the new Administration. All are very concerned aboutwhat might happen this summer. If a serious incident occurs, I am quitesure that Congress will legislate very quickly--whether it will legislatewisely is a different question. We have the opportunity with thisagreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny. If Congressacts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government totake direct responsibility for reliability. There are those in theDepartment of Energy who are pushing for such a role. Congressman Bartonis talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within thenext few weeks. If the industry pulls together, I believe we can forestalldirect governmental controls, just as in 1965. If the industry does notstep up, then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere. The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions signonto the agreement before it goes forward. For those Regions that areconsidering developing their own programs with their members before theysign the agreement, with the view of having the CAPG determine in advancewhether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, I ask youto consider this: If we don't get a critical mass of Regions to sign, thenthe CAPG may not come into existence. The NERC/Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to workto develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with theirmembers. My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement bythe March 30 Board meeting. That will assure that we are able to make thegovernance changes that we have all been working for. If any region isunable to sign by March 30, then use of the letter of intent would be a wayto demonstrate support for the program. That may be enough to satisfythose who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is acondition to their support of the governance changes. Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the workyou've put into this transition so far. Please let me know if you havequestions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be ofassistance to you.\nAnswer: sensitive"

We've established a company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes: 1. EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week. While facilities will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02. EES commodity team will also let the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal. Depending upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any \"headroom\" for REC purchases.Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in order for the \"greening\" of the building to go forward. The RECs can be purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES. HOWEVER, it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings toward purchase of the RECs. Facilities stated intent to do the latter.2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost for the RECs. Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the building. This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high. I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max of $125,000. There's several ways to slice this end. We can provide some of the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.3. Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs cost). We will then need to decide the following: a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for the RECs; b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs; c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change what they are currently paying for power.4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go 100% green in our headquarters. Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on the first draft. We need to determine if we can get the \"best\" press for this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times). We determined that the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100% green for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company to....... The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve speaks to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment. Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, particularly if this goes to Skilling. I'll keep you posted on the progress.

There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the same page. As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA (Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium (details attached below). If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 1st Fortune 500 company to \"go green\" in its headquarters building. Couple this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging. We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd). The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for actual commodity. It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in our messaging. The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, and steps for moving forward. The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza. In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year. Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM. In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on the company's liquidity position. Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The same could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall \"guidance\" question. Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Here is the feedback (combined with my own appreciation of how people feel) and some very humble suggestions that I hope will help. During the EGAS session, people felt very good about being able to air out their concerns and about getting \"official information\" as to the proposed merger and implications on the company. Some times, even if no new information is provided, people simply feel better because an effort is made to communicate with them. People appreciated your open-ness and the frank-ness with which you addressed some of the tougher questions regarding long term employment viability or security. On the other hand, people read a message into the statements regarding the fact that retention packages will be developed for key individuals. They read that if they didn't get a retention package they should be looking for a job because they are not key. Perhaps, bluntly, that is exactly what the message is but now you have many people spending their time trying to figure out the \"definition of key individual.\" People like to feel important (non-core is, for them, non-important) and absent that they worry about every little thing - many of these no one can help or mitigate. Finally, people took comfort in the comment regarding how long it might take for all to be sold (i.e,. approx. 3 years) and understood and felt better that no fire sale will take place. My biggest recommendations are:- We need to keep up our communication efforts; people feel important and feel better if folks make an effort to communicate; Pete and I (and others) need to work on communicating further with each of our teams and on motivating them to support the company during these tough times but both you and Jim should continue to update people as often as possible.- We need to move quickly to identify our key people so that we can be effective about retention efforts; my own view is that you start with the field; those are your most critical individuals because they are running the asset. - We need to continue to deliver the message that the merger is a good thing and that it is not simply another \"life\" bought out by Enron (i.e., many people felt and still feel that there is still a chance Enron might make on its own and would pay the breakage fee to get out of the Dynegy deal - this may be more hope than belief but that is the case). A key distinction that I noted in the meeting today was that it sounds as though we will move forward very aggressively to sell all of the EGAS assets. There is no longer the attitude or position that: if the asset has good earnings and good cashflow, then what's the hurry. The message today (and forgive me if I mis-read it) was: we will put together a corp. development group that will be focused on selling EGAS assets even if they are performing assets - cash is still king and will continue to be until the merger. Hope this helps and THANK YOU very much for taking the time to talk to us.\nAnswer: sensitive"

As I mentioned to Alice Weekley, I am unfamiliar with the recent amendments referenced requiring the notice for projects that do not actually cross reservation property. The amendment does not surprise me though. In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in '91, we developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included--the thinking by the various State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones, funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately unearthed. It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and consultation process....not only when objects were unearthed, but simply putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to construction. (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans together..Haha!!) As I said, I've not read the amendment , but hopefully it only legally requires 'notice'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing law, I've rarely seen a 'notice' that didn't crack the door or sound the alarm of further buerocratic opportunity! For your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and he's a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ; yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to 'perceived economic opportunity'. Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match, and is proud of it!! --which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes you--he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and \"plays\"in whatever stage opportunity is presented him--as long as he can be the center of attention. The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has his own!! Check it out--it's a hoot!! He has been chief for about 25 years (and I'm guessing he's maybe in his early 50's). The Seminoles have recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely a \"My way or the highway\" kind of guy--he loves you, hates you, or ignores you--and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn't like, he'll know no limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!! No Joke! I don't recognize the other names on the list, but I think it's clear from both the beurocratic issues, as well as the specific tribal issues incident to each affected tribe, everything associated with the process should be executed with all of this in mind. I'd be happy to speak with the project's lawyer to discuss this further, if information beyond that set forth above would be helpful. Thanks! --Christie. ----- Forwarded by Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2001 08:53 AM -----\nAnswer: sensitive"

The corporate policy committee is comprised of the most senior executives, including the Office of the Chairman, the leaders of the four business units and the heads of the corporate functions. In addition to the specific items mentioned above, the corporate policy committee was intended to discuss and resolve the major issues facing the company, including issues of strategy, personnel and challenges facing the company. The corporate policy committee has met three times so far, so not much history yet.

Below is a short excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning Enron: \"Proponents of renewable power viewed California's deregulation as flawed from the onset three years ago. Still, they anticipated that with adequate publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the traditional power supply, which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil fuels and nuclear power, and that the demand would spur supply. The number of producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow -- as long as the big utilities didn't interfere. That's what almost happened. Over the last three years, retailers like Green Mountain Energy and Utility.com bought green power already available in California and started to invest in building their own renewable energy generators, like windmill farms and large solar-panel assemblies. Still, for all the optimism and effort, only about 200,000 customers -- less than 1 percent of the 8.5 million households that had the option of switching providers -- chose to support them. Many of those were swayed by a deregulation-mandated credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who switched. When natural gas prices were high, the credit actually represented a real savings. Historically, environmentally conscious consumers have paid a penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, along with an average monthly surcharge of $5. Then, last fall, the fledgling industry started to crumble. Energy wholesalers like Enron (NYSE: ENE) and Calpine (NYSE: CPN) responded to a rising demand for energy by raising their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt hour to as much as $1.50. Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy power. Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a price that was less than their cost. When the energy crisis hit, many green consumers' bills more than doubled.\" In light of the recent e-mail that was sent out, I thought that I would bring this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that Enron does not raise prices, it transacts in a market where prices are set by supply and demand. The average person reading this could very easily come to the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy companies, which is clearly not the case. Nonetheless, thought you might find this of interest. Chris HilgertEnron AmericasEnron Compression Services\nAnswer: sensitive"

She characterized the RTO filing requirement as \"bizarre\". It appears to me that it is typical FERC behavior; FERC likes to use whatever leverage it has to force compliance. April 27, 2001 Plan on California Energy Has No Shortage of CriticsBy JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON, April 26 * A novel plan by federal regulators to control California's runaway electricity prices is a messy, politically motivated compromise that may offer some relief to consumers but will do little to fix the state's dysfunctional energy market, analysts said today. The intervention, announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday night after much haggling, was dismissed by a wide range of critics today as a flawed effort that satisfies no one. It fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation that California officials and some energy experts had advocated. But it also crossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders, including President Bush, by imposing price controls on some electricity sales to utilities. Under the agency's order, which takes effect on May 1, California regulators can begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity supplies fall to within 7.5 percent of consumer demand. The state is expected to face such shortages routinely this summer, and the order has the potential to shave billions of dollars off California's electricity bill if implemented fully, some people at the federal agency say. \"The president has a long-held belief that price caps don't work,\" the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said today. \"The last thing you want to do is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm the availability of supply.\" Mr. Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal agency, adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand its orders. But Mr. Bush did appoint the commission's chairman, Curtis L. H,bert Jr., a Republican. Like the president, Mr. H,bert has often insisted that price caps do no good. But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the agency's largely hands- off approach to the California crisis. Some of that pressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency, both Democrats, and Mr. H,bert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night. The split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether the president will seek to replace Mr. H,bert as chairman in coming weeks. Mr. Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the commission, including Pat Wood, a longtime ally of the president who served as chief electricity regulator in Texas. Industry executives say they expect that Mr. Bush will eventually name Mr. Wood to the commission's top post. In a reflection of how delicate the issue is, Mr. H,bert argued that the agency's action did not amount to imposing price caps. But his position appeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost- based electricity regulation (as some Californians favor) and the agency's decision to impose tactical price controls. Among California officials, the dominant reaction was disappointment. Some state regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing upside-down economics: it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of severe scarcity, when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage companies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity. The agency, its critics argue, has chosen to ignore price abuses during times of relative abundance, when power generators, the critics say, have used artificial market power to earn high profits. \"They got it exactly wrong,\" said Frank Wolak, chief market supervisor for the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid. \"It looks like they're doing something, but it doesn't work in real time.\" Mr. Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year * in amounts that he puts in the billions of dollars * occurred when electricity supplies were not acutely short, meaning that the agency's price caps would have had no mitigating effect. The state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer. But, Mr. Wolak said, generating companies have become adept at \"gaming\" the system. He predicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in California. One fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to affiliates out of state. When California's transmission grid managers scramble to find supplies, the same companies will offer to sell the power back to the state, but only above the cap price. The agency's new order includes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse, known as megawatt laundering. But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such mandates, and California officials are skeptical. The order also came under fire on other grounds. The commission said that price caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link its transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region, a priority of the agency that state officials have resisted. Linda Stuntz, an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the agency, called that clause bizarre, arguing that it held the entire California market hostage to a technical filing requirement. California politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were carried out as promised, relief would be too limited. The price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of the least efficient generating plant in the state. The order as written means that companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell power at large mark-ups during periods when caps are imposed. When the agency scrutinized the California market earlier this year, it found the high-cost generators to be justified in charging about $300 a megawatt hour for electricity, a price that is about 10 times as high as the state was paying for power a year ago.

California Governor Gray Davis may ultimately prove responsible for the dimming of more lights than Frank Sinatra music. California has done for energy deregulation what Florida has done for elections. California Governor Gray Davis says he?ll appoint a \"power plant czar\" to help solve the state?s energy crisis. There must be a sign on his desk saying, \"The buck stops here=06?just long enough for me to pass it to someone else.\" During the current energy crisis in California, the spotlight shines on Governor Gray Davis=06?so long as it?s not knocked out by rolling blackouts, that is. Gray Davis was shocked when told about the \"doomsday scenario.\" Not the one from Pacific Gas & Electric which envisions California power blackouts lasting 12 hours a day, the one from his aides saying he might lose the governor?s race in 2002. California politicians have learned what thieves have known for a longtime. It?s easier to pick someone?s pocket in the dark. California is talking conservation. One good conservation measure would be for Governor Gray Davis to save his breath trying to convince people that government control is the answer to the energy crisis.

Logical candidates include: Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Beavis and Butthead, and Siegfried and Roy. The environmentalist Green Party is well-named. Thanks to its role in blocking construction of new power plants, Californians are forking over plenty of green for energy. California?s power industry is very Kennedyesque. Their message to consumers is, \"Ask not what your energy company can do for you; ask what you can do for your energy company.\" Congress might get involved in California?s energy crisis. There?s nothing a drowning victim needs more than having an anchor thrown to him. It?s one thing for California politicians trying to solve the energy problem to go back to the drawing board, but do they have to ask taxpayers to buy them a new one? In California, lawmakers are now getting down to details. The latest debate involves what to name the bonds the state will issue to help bail out the utilities. Proposals on the table include: Blackout Bonds;Bailout Bonds; Davis Debts; Blunder Bonds; Fiasco Funds. ### ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 03/16/2001 01:31 PM -----\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to \"collect\" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its \"Est RT$\". If I am right, that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the \"HC\" or \"Est RT$\" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS. The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: * The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.* Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.* ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.* New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.* Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).* GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.* ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register. If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals) * Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers* Two (2) analysts* Two (2) contract administrators The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC: * iBuyit System* Catalog system (part of iBuyit)* iPayit system We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department. This would take very few staff adds to make that happen. Let me know if you need any further detail. Morris (713) 503-1409\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The complete version of the following paper is available on my web page at: www.whogan.com ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGHSTRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIAScott Harvey and William W. HoganApril 24, 2001 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Beginning in June of 2000, the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies to correct the apparent market failures.? The public debate and policy discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal problem amenable to regulatory solution.? However, design of effective policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the diagnosis of the underlying causes.? High prices attributable largely to an exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory action.? By contrast, high prices attributable to bad electricity market design would indicate a need for changes in the design.? High prices attributable to higher fuel prices, environmental constraints and capacity shortages, on the other hand, would prompt actions to address the cost of fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should receive the appropriate price signal for conservation. Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market.? But charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply.? Likewise, refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of market power.? Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers, the focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal generators in California. On its face, the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the exercise of market power could be important.? But at the same time the data show that there have been profound changes in the California market such that the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than demand has grown.? If anything, thermal generators that hit annual output limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000.? Furthermore, the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout the western market, both on and off peak,? indicate that if the exercise of market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels unprecedented in this or other electricity markets.? In short, this is a complicated story, and there is ample room for further investigation of the data and diagnosis of causes. Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the simplifying assumptions.? If strategic withholding were large and pervasive, then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored.? But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear, and any finding of the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions used in the analysis of the data.? For example, annual limits on production dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher than direct incremental costs; hence, examinations of output decisions for individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete.? The variation in real time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output compared to the expectations given day-ahead prices; hence, with capacity constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal production at average prices.? Limits on the ramping rate of generation units, start-up costs, minimum load costs and other operational inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twenty-four separate hours and must be analyzed chronologically, recognizing these factors.? And so on.? Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the previous evidence.? Unfortunately, the real details are neither simple nor incidental. It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly available data.? A fuller analysis would require data available only to the California Independent System Operator, and has not been done.? Many factors contributed to higher electricity prices in California, and the market power theme is only, at most, part of the story.? The import of the previous analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the California electricity market but, rather, to suggest that it might be important.? The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove that market power has not been exercised in the electricity market? but, rather, to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even be significant.? With the available data in the public domain, and the special complications introduced by the California market design, the margin of error in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of magnitude as the effect being measured.? On balance, to date the publicly available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred. By contrast, there is general agreement that the California electricity market design is =01&seriously flawed.=018? Furthermore, there is evidence that the policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an already serious market collapse.? Hence, without dismissing the possibility of the exercise of market power, the principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown. Separate from market power mitigation, California should pay its bills, raise incremental prices to retail customers, and move as quickly as possible to operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for all that includes unit commitment, day-ahead scheduling, and real-time balancing.? Although not a panacea, these steps would address immediate problems and set the stage for longer-term initiatives to expand generation capacity, transmission infrastructure, and the reach of an efficient market to the western interconnected grid.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Also, the Paycheck Fairness Act (S.77) was introduced in the U.S. Senate on January 22, 2001 and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. (Sponsors Mr. Daschle, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Johnson. Added after the bill was introduced.....Mr. Torricelli, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Feingold). It appears that this proposed act has some reporting requirements that could be very burdensome for us--it would probably make us have to re-think how we have our compensation system structured. Could someone in your group get a feel for what is happening with this in Washington and what kind of support it is getting? Thanks! The below was published in SHRM=01,s HRVoice - MARCH 2001 INSIDER Campaign To Enact Comparable Worth Legislation Launched In 12 States; Numerous Others Introducing Legislation On February 7, a number of state legislators, labor organizations, and policy advocates launched a campaign to promote state legislation that would strengthen current equal pay laws and encourage comparable worth pay systems. Although 12 states have been explicitly identified as targets for the passage of such legislation, a number of other states have already introduced bills to further address wage discrimination. Proponents of the campaign maintain that current national and state laws that mandate equal pay for equal work do not go far enough to remedy past and current discrimination in compensation. Therefore, they claim government intervention is necessary to raise women's or minorities' wages and eliminate gender and race-based wage discrimination. State legislators are considering varying proposals to remedy wage disparities, including: commissioning pay equity studies, increasing penalties for violations of current equal pay laws, or implementing mandated job evaluation and comparison (comparable worth) pay systems to raise wages for jobs that are traditionally dominated by women or minorities. The following states have been identified as targets of this legislation. For those states that have already seen legislation introduced, the bill numbers are also included: AlabamaArizona (Senate Bill 1266)Colorado (SB 41),ConnecticutGeorgia (SR 147)Massachusetts (HB 2110)New MexicoNevadaOhioTexas (HB 95) *House Bill 95 provides an employee who files a wage claim with legal protection from retaliation. Wisconsin West Virginia Other states not included in the campaign are also seeking wage discrimination legislation: Indiana (HB 1438) Iowa (HB 221, HB 226) Minnesota (HB 666, SB 638) Missouri (HB 115) Mississippi (HB 176, SB 2632-both died) New York (AB 3594, SB 2190-public sector employees affected only) Pennsylvania (HB 140) Rhode Island (SB 171) Wyoming (HB 239-passed Senate Feb. 29) For more information please visit the \"Equal Pay\" fact sheet at http://www.shrm.org/government/factsheets/default.asp?page=3Dfact-0101equalpay.asp\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The Mayor has asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment. As outlined in my December 6th memo -- the breakdown of the commitment was for Enron to contribute $500,000 for the Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show on December 31, 1999. The $250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package. The Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at the time. Will we be sponsoring the event? Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC in February 2000. Please let me know if you need additional information. Thank you.\nAnswer: sensitive"

No candidates should be referred to the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and resolved ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the candidate.Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary.John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out of town, these will be conducted via telephone. Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial StaffEffective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows:For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason or justification for offering them a contract.In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction.Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft financial terms on the familiar contract request form.Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail.Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a fresh draft will be produced.

In a nut shell, after reviewing this information, I feel it would be appropriate to contract for this service. The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results. We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G. If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation. I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most. Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help. ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM --------------------------- Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AM\nAnswer: not sensitive"

As follows: Aircraft: 1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours: ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program: 50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections. Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average. Last Annual inspection completed July 1999. 1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\". All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona. This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots. Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance. I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance. I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't. The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility. Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this. Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft. He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only. The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per month. Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year. They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare. If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols. Currently he only has two he uses. One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything. The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy. Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken. Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this. I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft. He leaves it strictly to the pilots. There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs. Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this. My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned. The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage. Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy. I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records. And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft. In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown. The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's. Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year. Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\nAnswer: sensitive"

They have agreed to pay the $5K for the equipment and installation. So now, in addition to Channel 2 mentioning \"WetherNet, brought to you by Enron,\" everytime they talk about the weather in downtown Houston, they will mention the current temp. at the Enron building.

Should I be putting Steve Kean on these email updates? As you all know, there were several governors events over the past 3 to 4 days in Washington DC: Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringer's office. They would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could participate in an Energy council that is being formed (actually commissioned by the legislature) to study energy issues for the state. Geringer would also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an assets based to a market based entity. We had contacted Scott Cealy (spelling) with Arizona Governor Hull's office last week and Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and had a chance to thank her for her leadership in opposing price caps. Mr. Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to see them. I will schedule that meeting (boy that Paul must have been charming at dinner!!!) I sat with Gary Smith, political guy with Gov Kempthorne's office who indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on Tuesday afternoon. Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting with Cheney, but there was speculation that he may not come. I have not confirmed the outcome of that meeting, but was invited by Mr. Smith to call him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow. I will place that call and see what I can find out. Mr. Racicot was going to get back to us on what he found out from Kempthorne---has Linda or Rick heard from him? I will be continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to him. We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March 30 that Governor Owens is sponsoring. Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens staff. As most of you know from previous updates, Owens is strong in his support against price caps and market based solutions. At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber. Linda--how do we want to follow up on that request? Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door open to future discussions. Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for now. We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt. I will continue to work on setting that up. Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock on that door. We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some commercial reasons. There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info, etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation. Emerson is being persistent. The key players from Emerson are David Farr, newly appointed CEO, and James Berges, President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic development effort. It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting. Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior management, (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities, and (iii) hold a discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its current form. The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation. I need your advice and recommendation. Please respond by e-mail or telephone (x5-4040). Background: Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000, when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot, both Emerson VPs of Corporate Development, visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean. I met them at that time. Since that initial meeting, Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power business, I believe with promising results. My sense is that Emerson is uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business. I am waiting to receive an update from Martin. Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM business. While we generally support that idea, we are pressing Emerson to reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business. Emerson is highly decentralized, and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful. I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a proposal from EES's bundled outsource business. Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

I am currently a Development Support Manager with EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM). Recently, I had the good fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer. He represents a company called IdleAire Technologies, Inc.. IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999. IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle their trucks while on long haul overnight stops. Their plan is to electrify truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling. Also, these units provide cable TV and internet services. They have already piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area. IdleAire's goal is to: \"........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television.\" Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, D.C. Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and Van Hilleary. Also, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire Technologies. These individuals support this technology because it reduces emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds. I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do. He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a strategic partnership to take their technology to market. Ron said that they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and the capital to invest in this project. Enron would benefit in several ways: 1. Greater than average returns. 2. Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role. (EPA Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....) 3. Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas. 4. Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader. 5. Open a whole new market for the energy services group. (EES) Long term maintenance contract, commodities, etc.... 6. Open a new market for the broadband services group. (EBS) Videos on demand. I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model. If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce him to you. They have a very comprehensive business plan that lays out their business in detail. I have arranged for him to provide us with an executive summary of the business. You can also find out more about the company by visiting their website at: www.idleaire.com Thank you for your time. Chad Tipton5-5310\nAnswer: sensitive"

Present were ESPs, consumer groups, business interests, the utlities and representatives from the Department of Finance, the DWR and Finance's Bond Counsel. The meeting was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowen's office. Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM/business coalition proposal. Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted either correspondence or draft proposals- the details of which can be discussed in tomorrow's conference call. Of particular note, and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da, was the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept. of Finance. He expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees (ie: all residential and small commercial customers < 100kw) and broad authority to opt out will make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds. We need to follow up with Finance, their counsel and DWR to allay their fears- the sooner the better. We need to be able to speak their language on bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in terms relavant to their bonding requirements. We can discuss this further in the call tomorow. Finally, Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek next. The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good- we have our work cut out for us. Until tomorrow. Norm\nAnswer: sensitive"

Monday was a holiday!Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with lastminute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills. -- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee. Thismeasure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilityas a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction. The bill alsoplaces the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages forgeneration units. Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onlyintention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages,but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manneroutlined in the bill. IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end alongwith CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the CaliforniaCogeneration Council. The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill.Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to theopposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen. The message fromthe opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as itpassed out of the committee on a party-line vote. IEP is currentlyreassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not theonly bill that proposes similar changes. -- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne,was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills. The first was AB 34x (LaSuer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includingsome IEP-sponsored language. IEP has a support if amended position on thebill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable. Lastminute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone ahearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26). However, because the Keeleyamendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill,La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committeeanalysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its currentform. AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committeewith only one =01&no=018 vote. AB 36x would provide expedited siting for arepower project, as defined. However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the billamended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects. Theauthor has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental communityand the CEC to develop language that works for everyone. IEP=01,s major issueat this point is that is should actually work. The measure was doublereferred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will beheard there next. -- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x(Battin). All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for themeasure. IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizingmembers on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure inthe Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing.

This guy (Jim Cofield) called me on my cell phone last night about 7:00 p.m. to get my e-mail address. He asked that I take a look at his e-mail in the morning and route it to the appropriate person within Enron. The \".jpg\" files below have no information in them, but the \".doc\" file is a 14 page document with numerous correspondence from Mary Beth Cahill, former director in the White House Office for Public Liaison, to Mr. Cofield regarding a trip to Nigeria that he supposedly accompanied President Clinton on several months ago; followed by a number of \"proprietary information documents\" that mean absolutely nothing to me; followed by an overview of Nigeria's electrical power situation; etc....The best I can tell, they are trying to get Enron to bid on some project in Nigeria. Since this e-mail is copied to the Vice President of the United States in addition to several ambassadors, I thought it might need attention. If you can figure it out, please let me know how to proceed.

The bottom line is that: 1. The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer. They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW. However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels. (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities. 2. There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects. It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all. As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units. In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical. 3. In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations. The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions, We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards. 4. The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown. While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at \"essential public services\" the increase in DG is expected from \"clean\" sources, not diesel emergency generators. 5. The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by this summer. They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for \"clean\" sources of generation in critical areas. Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside Wharton/Penn recruiting. In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons. This program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years. In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't in its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing. The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program. I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements. You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program.\nAnswer: sensitive"

I hope that I have given you most of the informationyou need to understand our concept and to be able to discuss it with yourcolleagues. We agreed that on my return to the UK I would set out how Enronmight be involved at this stage and be one of the first US firms to pioneerthe idea and become a GoodCorporation network member able to display theGoodCorporation trademark and start conversing with other members. Thosemembers could be private companies, public sector entities or governmentdepartments, trade associations, NGOs etc. As we discussed the GoodCorporation Charter and processes are nearcompletion . We are in the process of starting our pilot verifications whichwill be done by PwC, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Intertek, SGS and BureauVeritas.We are also setting up an Accreditation Body ( which is beingmodelled on the Forestry Stewardship Council) to oversee the annualverification process. The pilot programme provides companies with an excellent opportunity to havea low risk way of trying out the process and seeing if it works in theirorganisation. They can submit the whole or a small part of the organisation.Pilot companies pay for the verifiers' time only and the verifiers aregiving their time at cost ($750/ day.) The pilot itself will take the formof a preliminary scoping meeting in which the verifier will take the companythrough the evidence (policies and procedures) that need to be in place inorder to pass the GoodCorporation charter. The meeting will decide who needsto be interviewed, in which locations and therefore the number of daysinvolved. As the emphasis is on verifying policies and the way they areimplemented in the workplace rather than a full scale audit of impact, thenumber of days involved should be relatively limited. During the actualverification, the verifier will check for the evidence by reviewingdocumentation provided by the company, in addition to a series of meetingswith the relevant people, such as the HR Director, Environmental Manager,Finance Directors and customer-facing staff. Assuming it is successful, thepiloted part of the company can then become a member of the network if theyso choose. It would be great to have Enron involved in this early piloting. Given yourcurrent policies and ethics I wouild be surprised if the charter posed anyreal problem for you . It could also be a useful supply chain tool for youto encourage your suppliers not only to say they behave in the manner youwish them to behave but also demonstrate this behaviour to you and theoutside world in a transparent fashion. Please get back to me if you requireany further clarification and of course I and my colleagues would bedelighted to meet whoever else you need to get involved before a decision ismade. Again, many thanks for your time and I was delighted that you wereenthusiastic about our concept. With very best regards Vicky Pryce Chairman, GoodCorporation\nAnswer: sensitive"

It is remarkable (and troubling for Enron) that Lockyer's political peers / rivals have not taken him to task for his outrageous remark; nor have the major newspapers. In Today's editorial, the usually conservative LA Times refers to Lockyer as having \"boosted the rhetoric a notch.\" (I'd hate to witness two or three notches.) This lack of criticism could foreshadow a contagious attitude that powerful Enron is in fact the one to blame (facts be damned). Given Enron's high profile policy and fundraising ties to the Bush administration and Governor Gray Davis' war with President Bush and Texas energy companies, there could be more turbulence ahead.

Gen. Bill Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houston-based power company should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous, tattooed inmate named Spike. Lockyer, who is investigating whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that appeared Tuesday. \"I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' \" Lockyer said. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called the comment \"counterproductive rhetoric\" that \"does not merit a response.\" But other industry representatives denounced the remark as \"outrageous,\" especially because neither Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges against Enron or other companies. \"You'd expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges first and make public statements second,\" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and traders. \"We're very disappointed with his choice of words, which don't exactly fit the profile of his office.\" In an interview Tuesday, Lockyer said he decided to \"ratchet up\" the commentary to \"put [energy companies] on notice\" that \"we are not afraid of them and have the will to prosecute.\" \"What I'm trying to do is let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them, they're going to be prosecuted,\" Lockyer said. \"Just because they're multimillionaires and run big corporations, it doesn't provide them with immunity.\" The attorney general is investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market. Several panels, including a state Senate committee and the California Public Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes. On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators. The attorney general went to court to obtain the documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand them over. Lockyer said the forthcoming documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice laws. \"Evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity,\" Lockyer said. \"But we need to make sure it's compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury.\" Lockyer said he singled out Enron's chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader. At least one observer found Lockyer's comments refreshingly candid. Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers Union, said, \"Let Lockyer be Lockyer.\" * * * Times staff writer Dan Morain contributed to this story.

This will form the four quadrant standards setting organization. It was recognized that each of the four quadrants would devlop on their own pace and lack of formation of any one quadrant would not inhibit the formation of EISB itself. The GISB Board also recognized a comment from PJM who asked to strike out language in the Strawman 2.1 that referenced NERC and AGA as two physical reliability standards organizations. Many electric wholesale customer, including EPSA and Enron, have argued that reliability and commercial issues are inseparable and believe there should not be artificial limits to what the wholesale electric quadrant should be able to address. The GISB Board recognized this concern, but rather than strike the language, it was recognized that the words were only in a preamble and instructed the drafting of the new charter to not include such language.\nAnswer: sensitive\n\n---\n\nQuestion: The G"

What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border? 2. What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?3. Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an operational sale is necessary?4. In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to previous years?5.

It provides an California view on how the shakeup in the Senate might impact the state's energy situation.

I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.) I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency. I am often at odds with \"the industry view\" regarding CFTC issues. I don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater. I am looking for some good folks. Have at least one person who would be good at that job. And it's not Newsome. Please do not share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too free market and have argued against their \"fixes\"). Sorry for this scathing review, but this is an important appointment. Wendy\nAnswer: sensitive"

The letter is attached way at the bottom of this e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies. I have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it was delivered. I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the strategies we are developing. Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air \"messages\" that we can use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with the Administration, revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses, responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A, and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work. The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most part. I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like: \"Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?\" In my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions. Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken. For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile in London) -- \"Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions. However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results.\" I believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its shareholder initiatives, etc. Also, this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to, like: What about Kyoto is not workable? What would make it workable and would we help make it workable? If not Kyoto, what is Enron's preferred \"vehicle?\" I'd really rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid reference to Kyoto altogether. I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace. I would be happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject, or just field comments by e-mail -- whatever works best. Thoughts?

Several of our offices (Spain, Belgium,Netherlands) have received a local language version of the letteroriginally sent to Jeff Skilling, and other CEOs, on 5 April 2001. Theemail chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation. Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week. Jackie Gentle hasmade me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue. We havediscussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initialstatement to acknowledge receipt of the letters, perhaps followed by astandardised, corporate- approved letter, but would like to ensure ourapproach is supported, and consistent with any actions, by Corporate. Assome of the countries in which we operate have tangible \"green\" focusedprojects e.g. we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands, it may beappropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in locallanguage. If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response toGreenpeace's questions, I suggest we consider the following issues raisedrecently by Jackie Gentle: \"In response to several requests for clarification, I have spoken with MarkPalmer who has provided the following information on Enron's stanceregarding Kyoto: Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workablesolution to dealing with CO2 emissions. However it is not the principlesbehind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that hasbeen devised to deliver the results. We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhousegases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurablyreduced carbon dioxide as well as SO2 and Oxides of Nitrogen (Nox) By way of example .... emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be implemented Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gas-fired power plants which produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal or oil-fired plants demand-side management programs through EES to reduce energy usage the Catalytica program focus on renewable-related projects At the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on theKyoto issue.\" Before we proceed, I would be grateful if you could contact me to shareyour views on this.

He was appointed in 1998 to term which expires in June 2001. Commissioner Newsome visited Enron in 1999 and will again visit Enron to meet with Jeff Skilling (also EnronOnLine executives) on March 6, 2001. The CFTC has 5 Commissioners. Commissioners Newsome and Spears are Republicans and Commissioners Erickson and Holum are Democrats, with one opening. If Newsome becomes Chair, then there will be two open seats. If Newsome if passed over, there will only be open seat. Commissioner Newsome has the support of Majority Trent Lott. He is well liked in industry because of his free market philosophy and belief in competition and deregulation. While not a technical expert, he is a \"known quantity\" at the Commission. Newsome played a major role in the Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) which became law last Congress. This law brought legal certainty and modernization to the commodity trading community. With Newsome, industry is consulted before regulations are issued. Industry generally believes that Commission Newsome is the right candidate to oversee the CFMA rulekmaking which is currently underway. The other candidate for the position was former North Carolina Senator Lauch Faircloth whose nomination was being championed by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX). We have learned that Faircloth has lost interest, because he would have to divest sizeable interest in agriculture holdings. The concern now is that because this is a third tier appointment, unknown candidates will suddenly appear without industry input. A quick nomination and confirmation of Commissioner Newsome as Chairman is recommended by many in the industry. Do you think it appropriate to have Ken Lay raise this nomination with the transition team?

My chief concern was the pre-637 contracts that are not in our transactional reports. Most of the discount letters include confidentiality provisions and we're required to seek confidential treatment if required to disclose the contracts. I was hoping to find that none of the information about these contracts had been disclosed in any public forum. However, I think our shippers (and TW) would be hard-pressed to claim that the info FERC is requesting is confidential. These shippers' names and contract rates are disclosed in our monthly discount reports to FERC. (I assume we do not seek confidential treatment of these reports -- let me know if I'm mistaken.) Quantities, expiration date and receipt and delivery points for these shippers' contracts appear on the Index of Customers on our website. I would recommend that we not request confidential treatment because I can find no convincing basis for saying this information is confidential. Let me know whether you concur.

I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE HURT HIMSELF AGAIN. In which case, GSP owns it. However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement. He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return to work from worker's comp. I know that we have an ongoing dispute about worker's comp with MG at this point. What would be your recommendation on bringing these employees back to work? As a bit of additional info, one of the two employees seems eager to come back . . . the other one does not. An employee told me that the second employee actually has a lawsuit filed against MG/old GSP about his injury.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Charles does make a good point about the deference language. As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance. At a minimum, that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB. Similarly, the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft. You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents: (1) that FERC is rushing and being heavy-handed and (2) that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities (i.e., no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedy). Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days. Once Capitol Hill is up and running again, we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to members/staff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion draft's treatment of RTOs. << File: DraftCommentsOnBartonRTO102201.doc >>\nAnswer: not sensitive"

These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants. Second, these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service. I don't have any law to support the second idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.\nAnswer: sensitive\n\nQuestion: I am not sure if"

You can inform them that they should keep the books in stockand probably order a few more copies. I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swampedwith work as usual. I was on the road for the last 2 weeks. The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in one night)but we survived without major problems. The only problem I had was an overflowing swimming pool (it took 45 minutes to go from a comfortable slack to a full condition). Vince\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I cannot give you a personal recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a trade secret or as a patented commodity. I ultimately struck a compromise position by filing my own \"provisional patent application.\" This establishes the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent? or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys. Of these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for your son's software idea. He talked as though he had a particular specialty in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive. He practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408) 282-1856. I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office. Basic information and forms can be downloaded from there. Two other, newer sites might also intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of intellectual property, patents, etc. They are: pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) yet2come.com Hope this is helpful.

A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is. Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph? Is this true? (And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not). If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it.

It's nice to hear from you. Ive been trying to get in touch with yall for quite some time. Please reply back to this message and let me know how \"Things\" are. Yes, the question is ambiguous, but try to go with it. In response to \"What up?:\" Everything has reached a new status quo. I live in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma (UWT for short). Class is great and their are plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing pleasure. Hopefully I will be out of GH soon. I will start looking for jobs in Portland, Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring. I have not been working on my tan. I would really like to visit the city of Roses in the next few weekends. What are your plans? I hope everything is well with you. Please write back soon.

I live in Garden Oaks (which is located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the Heights). Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put in open drainage (which is basically ditches in the front of all the properties). Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches. My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale (approximately 2,500 feet). I have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 for about the last 4 years (generally once a month) to ask them to please come out and regrade our ditches. (The Public Works Department only has records over the last year because they changed their computer system and lost many files including mine.) For the last year or so I have been receiving a more positive response when I call which is: \"This is a Code 1 priority and will schedule as work load allows.\" Although this response is encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears. Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might help expedite this work request. I would be extremely grateful if there is anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

See below. > http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/ A 1960 Moment Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democrats--and everyone else--something to cheer about. BY PEGGY NOONAN Monday August 7, 2000 4:26 p.m. EDT The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gore's running mate is so smart, so clever, so good, so satisfying, so striking that it just may turn this election a bit on its head for a while. Certainly its most immediate effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los Angeles, because now the Democrats, badly hit by their own form of Clinton fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their presidential candidate, have something to cheer about. They respect Joe Lieberman. They think he has a center, a moral and ethical view of the world. He is experienced and articulate. He is decent and intelligent. He is independent. The media love him. He is a regular co-star on Imus, and all of the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers, and all of the electronic pundits and anchors, know him and admire him. But that is not what is most wonderful. What is most wonderful is that he is an Orthodox Jew. What does this mean? It means a lot of people who love America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and great breakthrough has occurred. A friend, a journalist who is politically conservative and Jewish, e-mailed me to tell me he had been weeping all morning, that he'd cried when he heard the news. Another friend, a producer at a TV news show, called and told me she woke her father in California to give him the news and they both got choked up. \"This is like 1960,\" she said, and I said I know, and I got choked up. It is wonderful when America is at her most American, and breaks down another barrier and says \"What's in your heart is most important.\" If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee, and an Episcopalian, Al Gore would have been smart to pick him. He would have been an obvious choice. The only reason he would have hesitated over Mr. Lieberman is that he's Jewish. Mr. Gore decided that was just fine. I think that I have never seen Al Gore do such an elegant, intelligent and original thing. Well done, Mr. Gore. I have to tell you, this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me. I was a little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president, and I had gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Don't Elect Catholics to the Presidency. When it happened, it's hard to describe how exciting and moving and idealism-inspiring it was. It gave a lot of people a lot of joy. It opened things up more. That was a good thing. So is this. And because this is such a good thing, I hope everyone of whatever politics or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it. Everyone should be nice and not do any political bashing until . . . Friday. However, I think it's okay and maybe even helpful to note the following. Network producers are going to decide, in their bright and touchingly uninformed minds, that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be Christian conservatives. That's where they'll go for the negative sound bites. But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman. They've been arm in arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade. He was just about the only Democrat who'd give them the time of day. He was on their side. The last time I saw Mr. Lieberman was last spring, in New York, at a symposium on Hollywood and the culture. I moderated and introduced our guests--Joe Lieberman and Bill Bennett, who are close friends and co-warriors in the values battle. Lieberman and Bennett very frankly talked to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie stars about how to make television and film and music more decent, more helpful. This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr. Lieberman--as a good guy with his head screwed on right. Many conservative Christians--I think most conservative Christians--see all of those who love God as part of the same \"cultural minority.\" Conservative Christians don't feel they have much in common, in terms of their political desires, with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and such. But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews. They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative gathering; they crowd around Dennis Prager, Michael Medved, David Horowitz and scores of others. One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians is an Orthodox Jew called Dr. Laura; the last time I saw her she was wowing them at a born-again Christian assembly at the National Prayer Breakfast last February. A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that there's \"no upside\" to the Lieberman choice. I told him there's no downside. He was surprised and said, \"He can't even campaign on Saturdays!\" I said so what, America would love to see a politician who actually put God first one day a week. I wish I'd added this: Remember Sandy Koufax? Joe Lieberman not campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur. There were a lot of great sports moments in the 1950s and 1960s, but none greater than the day in 1965 when Mr. Koufax put God before the World Series. What a great guy, what a lesson for a generation of Christian and Jewish kids. And Muslims and everyone else too. Yes, it's good news for Hillary. It's great news for Hillary. It enlivens part of her New York base, it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are the party that did this great thing, it excites people--and may help them forget, or at least not remember so vividly, that the Democratic senatorial candidate has, shall we say, a not fully satisfying relationship with New York's Jews. A historic choice like the Mr. Lieberman can overwhelm a lot of previous bad static. But let's not care about that for now. The headline is not \"Is It Good for Hillary?\" The headline is: \"It Is Good for America.\" It is a wonderful country that does something like this, that takes a good man who is a member of a small ethnic/religious minority to be one of its two major vice presidential candidates, and that greets that choice with resounding hurrahs. This is really a great day. We should all be happy. We really are a maturing democracy.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I am planning to arrive there on Thursday morning to talk to Rick, to Dan Reck and to Shawn Cumberland.

I am also wirting because I am taking your word on Melissa's knowledge of the real estate market inside the loop. Elsa is coming with me on Thursday morning and we would like to see if it is possible for us to meet with Melissa on Thursday, Friday or Saturday for advice and orientation.

I know you have a thousand other things on your plate, not the least of which is California, so I understand if the answer is no. However, they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon. On a related subject, I'm contemplating another topic for the conference. I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled \"Managing for the Slowdown.\" It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn. (Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.) The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now. (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people. Overhaul your budget process.

I believe that your remarks,along with those of Goran Lindahl, Dick Foster, and Phil Condit of Boeing,have caused a significant stir in the preparation for the congressionallymandated Quadrennial Defense Review and the Secretary's transformationplanning. I also can tell you that the feedback from participants regardingyour briefing has been terrific. We are reviewing all the material this week to begin the process ofre-creating the session on the Secretary's webpage for the Forum, and I willbe going over the video and audio clips for posting. Recognizing that yourslides were proprietary, it would be most valuable if we could post as muchof your powerpoint briefing as possible--whatever you feel comfortable withsharing. Whatever that turns out to be, if your staff could email that tome, I will make sure that only that, and not the original that you sent tome, gets posted. I am not sure where the senior leadership of the DoD will be going in thecoming months, however, I know that the discussion of your experience atEnron and the experiences of your panel mates will have an influence. A more formal letter of thanks will be forthcoming, but for now, thank youagain for joining us and helping to make this a memorable and most importantHighlands Forum.

I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh. Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not. The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no. Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse. But I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai. Wade\nAnswer: not sensitive"

You probably remember Krishnafrom his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects. A brief outline of the facts. 1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few yearsago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survivalwas a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancyis also very complicated. 2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a tourist visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed theterm of the visa during the previous visit. The irony is that they complied withthe US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted. The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the State Department. I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontationalapproach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run. I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna'sbehalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. I shall fax to you a copy of the decision. Thanks. Vince << File: Krishna's Letter.DOC >>\nAnswer: sensitive"

If there is a problem, let me know. 2) A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering. I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies. I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem.

Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software Strategy that provides a strategic, top-down focus on competitive intelligence. However, EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and market research. We are providing the business units with the information that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level. Amy's view is that competitive intelligence (CI) belongs at the corporate level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company. You and I both know this is not the way Enron operates. I hope this e:mail does not sound negative but I did want you to know that EBS is providing information and intelligence to its business units -- it is just not in the context that Amy thinks it should be in. If you have any questions, please let me know.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to). That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I have had surgery in the interior of my mouth, specifically the lower right side of my tongue. My dentist had suspected cancer and sent me to an oral surgeon who biopsied the area. This biopsy confirmed the dentist's opinion and off I went to MD Anderson for examination. MDA was more optimistic of diagnosis but said the area needed to be excised in any event which occured at MDA last Wednesday (the 11th). I have been at home recovering since. It has been difficult to speak although it is now much better. I will return to MDA in a month for a follow-up exam. Hopefully the excision was complete and no additional follow- up treatments will be necessary. I have missed several critical meetings and just haven't \"been around\" but I wanted everyone to know that its not because I've lost interest. Thanks for patience, Rick\nAnswer: sensitive"

In a nutshell, our strategy seems to have worked and we've won all the concessions we sought. As you'll recall these were: a) to get the BLM to withdraw any \"interim\" policies, the first of which split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications, and a later version that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting;b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual \"comparable\" assessments (the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold);c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 2001; andd) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders, including Enron. Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d. The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination. The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed. The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed. But since our issue was settled at the staff level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being re-examined and challenged. In fact, any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months. Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward. Details are forthcoming, but Enron would be involved closely in the process. The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to negotiate. But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal year. And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and organizing and leading the 20-member Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way Coalition, we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the communications field.

The following developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far. Developments: House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to appropriations, \"omnibus\" or other must-pass measures. They are somewhat angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps. Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage under suspension of the rules. Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning in House Democrats. Senator Patty Murray called the White House and expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution. In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that package on an omnibus or appropriations bill. Sources close to Rep. Dingell indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to accept tougher provisions. Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to changing the Senate bill at all. However, Senator Murray and Republican Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations bill. The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if no legislation passes at all. It is unclear what could or would be contained in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill. We are working with sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy. Strategy going forward: Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing \"what industry could live with\" in terms of provisions added to the Senate bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the Senate bill and only the Senate bill. It was approved unanimously in the Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill. Consistent with what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting pieces of it as a compromise. We will be shoring up support for our position of \"if anything moves forward, it should be the Senate bill only\" with Senate supporters and leadership in the House and Senate. We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in case their vote becomes an issue. In support of Senator Gorton's election troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder the blame for the bill's defeat. In particular, we are hopeful that Senator McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the Senate bill. Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the session is over (which now could be as late as October 20). I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur. Jeff\nAnswer: sensitive"

I read an interesting lawreview article on \"The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States,\" fora discussion of presidential powers. There is no general emergencyauthority granted the President in the U.S. Constitution. Also, thearticle discussed the famous \"Truman steel mills case,\" Youngstown Sheet &Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), in which the Supreme Court declaredunconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during theKorean War. In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike inthe national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the nationaldefense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce totake possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running. TheSupreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such anaction, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or theConstitution itself. Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizureauthority, it invalidated the President's action. The Supreme Court alsorejected the argument that the President had any powers that could beimplied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution. Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course ofaction to look for specific authorities given to the President by statutewhich might prove useful. I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would beentering \"martial law-type\" legal territory, where the President would beacting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority (whichhas been described a \"zone of twilight\"), and in light of the Truman steelmills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.

There are Executives from companies such as The New Power Company, Cinergy and Entergy committed to speaking at the event. More information can be found in the document below.

A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation. I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB. I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion. I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT. The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project. In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward. So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project. I wanted you to be aware of this; also any guidance you can provide would be helpful. Thanks John\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The videos are created, housed and maintained in Beth Tilney's area.I mentioned to Beth that Corporate may have an interest in sharing/utilizing the EES video equipment and expertise. Robert Pearson (our in-house film expert) has a masters in video programming, taping, etc. And the good news....within the next few weeks, the editing equipment will be fully up and running.Once installed and operational, all in-house produced videos will have the look and feel of those created by outside vendors. Please feel free to contact Beth (ext. 3.5022) if you have an interest in exploring this concept. And thank you again for your participation. Best-Kim\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Steve--the field staff don't get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management.\"\"Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton. Their perspectives are very good . . .\" Clearly, your participation provided much value to the group and we appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share information. You should expect that we'll be asking you to come back again! Regards, - Roger\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples. The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line. Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids. FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance, but in a non-public way. There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30. I would like to put the following in these comments: Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there. The best folks can do is make up stuff.We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring. But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines.The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently the case. We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid. This was a deal brought up in the conference. Let me know how this sounds. Thanks.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I'm still awaiting additional suggestions fromanyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things. If the business school wants to go forwardwith a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeffhas said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen, what do you think?I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chiefeconomist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanfordeconomist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more thananyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,Australia, and California. He speaks a mile a minute though and hisunderstanding of policy and politics is a bit naive. I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute. I heard from MichaelBerg this morning. So he will not be participating in our discussions either. My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school. One positive outcome ofthis would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notcheconomic policy faculty. Overshadowing is possible.

Perhaps you can forward this. I just received a phone call from Carl Shapiro. He began by saying that he and several people from the Business School (Severin Borenstein, George Cluff) are planning an electricity deregulation mini-conference that sounds exactly like ours, and wanted to check so that we don't step on each others toes and perhaps can do it together. They even had October in mind for their timing. We are further along then they are, however. My first response to him was that because our event is alumni-initiated, I am not sure that they would want this to be other than a GSPP event. By the end of our conversation, we were discussing GSPP co-sponsorship with two other campus units: IBER and UEI. Neither are schools. Carl is Director of the Institute for Business and Economics Research, a campus-wide organized research unit (and Rich Gilbert assists in this). UEI is Severin's group, the university-wide energy research institute. Carl suggested that they could help with administration and perhaps some modest support if we do this together. Carl himself is on the Market Surveillance Committee of the ISO, and I think would hope to have some speaking role. He also mentioned Frank Wolak of Stanford as a speaker. I think it would be good to try and work out this co-sponsorship. It would mean allowing some of them (Carl and Severin?) into our planning group. There connections are probably very valuable to us, and they really are on the same wavelength. The alternative of GSPP going it alone after this initiative seems to me to be bad feelings and crossed-wires that would be no good to anyone. Reactions? Lee\nAnswer: not sensitive"

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE service. The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now. We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU, and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues. We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together. Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar. This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance. We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress. A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me). I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask. If timing is bad for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative. I will follow up with a phone call to you. Hope this helps.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write toremind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointlyattending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17. Per the Astros'schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nightsfor a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.

I have attached my resume to help bring you up to date on my career. As you will see, I have been providing advisory services since 1995. During these years, I have done some of my best work. I am proud of the service that I have rendered as an independent consultant. Now, I feel it is time to move to a new chapter in my career. I look forward to sitting down with you to think through ways to apply my experience, intellect and energies to new professional challenges. I respect you tremendously, and wherever the next part of my career may lie, I know that my search and choice will benefit significantly from your perspective. Finally, I am attaching the recommendation to HBS that you wrote in 1981. I found it during a profoundly challenging period in my life. Your historic words of support helped me keep fighting and successfully moving forward. If you would like to reach me before our meeting, please call (213) 926-2626 or email kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net . Thank you again. Sincerely, [IMAGE] Kevin Attachments (2) - image001.png - image002.gif - Resume of Kevin Scott.doc - Skilling HBS Recommendation.doc\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Perhaps we can contact those who have particular groups (e.g. Weather) for updates on their list. I am generally of the opinion that the lists should be as short as possible. A directory that Lance and I share with the power group was deleted yesterday but nobody knows who did that. I hope after this audit is done, we are much less at risk of something that like happening again. Thanks,Martin << File: Data Research.xls >>\nAnswer: not sensitive"

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza. In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year. Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM. In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on the company's liquidity position. Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The same could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall \"guidance\" question. Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

We appreciate thesuggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontestedsettlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around theelements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer ofSettlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest. Weencourage your active participation in this process.

As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week. We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey's leadership. She explored my views about doing business with government. Shortly thereafter, Dave's office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26. Kay Chapman explained that Dave's schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16. In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday. (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.) Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet? Thank you for your all of your help.

The schedule has moved back about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to produce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on those revised prices. Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due until October 26. In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported that the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order until October 15, 2001. A revised schedule is attached. (To see how it has changed, you can toggle Track Changes | Hightlight on Screen on and off) The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections rather than actual changes to the schedule. Notably in today's case, Seattle and Tacoma waived all cross on TFG witnesses, including Enron's. Alan Comnes\nAnswer: not sensitive"

As some additional information regarding the request, Kathy, Diane Taylor and I met with Deana Taylor this afternoon to understand what each person's role was and the specific access needed. For the interim, we are recommending that the HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP and View Payroll and Time ENTP role be granted to each of the individuals listed below. Until January 1, this function was performed in the Payroll Department and at that time was transitioned to Karen and Deana's group. The people listed below actually transferred from the Payroll Department. For the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this group that would let them access only those data elements needed. I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting your approval as well. These people have basically been prevented from being able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc. for the past week. Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional information.Thanks.Jo Ann\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed. The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job. Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc, through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly. Equally as important, the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger). Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC. I hope this \"pleads our case\" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.

Ordinarily, I would be happy toparticipate. However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) onOctober 1. Judging from the last time she went through this I will have tostay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10. Too bad. On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company toget in touch with me? I would like to set something up with MIT'sexecutive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, includingenergy purchases and management. We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas andelectricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an evergrowing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computerfacilities and laboratories. I'm sure that we can do it more efficientlyand I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities toout-source some or all of these activities. I would like to put them intouch with someone at Enron. Thanks Paul Professor Paul L. JoskowElizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics and Management andDirector, MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy ResearchE52-280BMITCambridge, MA 02142-1347\nAnswer: not sensitive"

My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel. Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize. Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering. These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process. I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US. We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses. Thanks! John Sherriff (Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports) We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises. In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending. In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect: Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include: all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details. John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered. Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved. So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel. Please communicate this policy to your staff. Michael Brown\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I know you have a thousand other things on your plate, not the least of which is California, so I understand if the answer is no. However, they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon. On a related subject, I'm contemplating another topic for the conference. I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled \"Managing for the Slowdown.\" It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn. (Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.) The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now. (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people. Overhaul your budget process. Don't stop communicating. etc.) I think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our managers. I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea. (Is it appropriate for Enron or am I just seeing the world through bleak-colored glasses?)

These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the \"Review Team\" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the \"Resource Group\" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline: <http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp> If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures.

If you believe that this e-mail has beensent to you in error, please reply to the sender that youmight have received the message in error. Then pleasedelete this e-mail. Thank you. Gentlemen, I am not sure who else should be included withthis e-mail, but I wanted to summarize some thoughts andrequest additional documents and information. We will have a tough burden at the hearing on Monday at2:00, simply because at each of the cuts they had severalwitnesses present while Enron had none, or perhaps one ortwo. After talking with Don Beamis it sounds like for the mostpart we photographed and investigated the cuts after thefact. Even though they may be completely at fault, proving itwill be another thing. We can assume it will be a swearingmatch between witnesses. I hope to meet with Don BeamisTomorrow or Friday to discuss cut reports, photographs,etc.To prevail, I think we will need to show the following:That Enron owned an easement at the site of each cut, thatEnron placed its cable within that easement, that Enron orthe locators properly marked the location of the cable, thatEnron or the locator complied with the Wyoming statutoryrequirements to respond One Call and mark the easement,and that the markings complied with the statute, orrecognized standards in the industry. If we can prove theabove, we should be able to show that it was Broadwing'sfault from there.In light of the above, I think I need the following from Enron orother sources: Right-of-Way Grants or Easement Agreements for locationsof the cuts; Plats / surveys / legal descriptions / filed with One Call orcounty for the area of each cut; Photographs and Cut Reports for each Cut (I have most cutreports and some photographs); Correspondence by Katie Nelson (?) referenced byBroadwing authrizing it to proceed without marking; All correspondence with Broadwing; Call One records documenting the day and time of all callsfrom Broadwing; Map of Wyoming for demonstrative purposes to showlocation of the cuts to the judge; It would be nice, for demonstrative purposes, to have a onefoot piece of fiber optic cable; I don't know that we will use each of the above, but I shouldreview it and then make the decision. Whoever has someor all of the above please overnight it to me. As far as witnesses, we will need Don Beamis and otherswho investigated the cuts, one or more locate people totestify as to how the markings were placed and theaccuracy of the markings, Brad Cheney as to irreperableharm to Enron which cannot be compensated for withdamages, others? You should each think about your conversations withBroadwing to recall any admissions - I see in one of Brad'se-mails that the Mears contractor acknowledgedresponsibility for one of the cuts. Don Beamis can testifythat Bud Black acknowledged at a meeting with the UintaCounty Commissioners that the \"markings on Enron's line\"had not been a problem. I don't know if Bud was in the fieldand that acknowedgment may not get us far. The one byMears may help. Who could testify to what the standard for marking in theindustry is? the locate people, or Brad? Finally, opposing counsel has insisted that he be givenequal time at the hearing, which may be limited to threehours. So we will be trying to fit a lot of evidence in a veryshort time period. After you have read this please give me your thoughts,and/or pass this on to others who may have additional factsor information that would be helpful. Thanks.\nAnswer: sensitive"

I very much enjoyed meeting with youand your message, that your Chairman Kenneth Lay confirmed for dinner withour Mayor Petra Roth was very well received and we are all very excited andlooking forward to November 30. However it raises great interest in the question of organization of thedinner and the additional participating chairpeople of other companies. WillEnron now invite for that dinner, which I understand will be the gatheringof 10-12 major decision makers in the energy field? If you could be so kindas to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to thatpoint, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate. An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would bethat a business-group would host an event, which could include a wideraudience of business people of Houston. After having spoken with the GermanConsulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, itunfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater HoustonPartnership, whose President was on vacation last week. I would welcome anyassistance in getting us in contact with them. Probably it would not taketoo many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea ofpromoting our ideas. To help you pass them, I again include our plan forHouston (see attached doc). I will be in contact with your colleague Mark Palmer with regards to thepress-coverage. Thank you for your response to your earliest possibleconvenience. Yours Sincerely\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The Puerto Rico and Ventane simulations have yet to be scheduled but need to be completed prior to year end. Asset Operations will outsource crisis simulation training commencing in January of 2000 but to complete this years objectives, Andre's assistance is necessary.As has currently been the practice, Asset Operations will pick up the expenses for his time and efforts.

I want to remind you that recommended conference attire is business casual. If you do not have a Stanford parking permit (either by mail or at yourhotel), please drive to the conference facility, park, and obtain one atthe meeting room. Detailed directions can be found on the website but hereis a summary from Highway 101 North & South: Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university.Stay in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus. At thefour-way stop, turn right onto Campus Drive. Take first left (Lasuen Street)and drive to the end and park. Conference site is at this building. If you donot yet have a parking permit, we will give you one there. I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting.Hill *******************************************************************Hillard G.

The purpose is to allow traders to utilize the load and supply data in EMSS without the hassle of a full-blown simulation. The software would be designed to allow traders to develop a market (or supply) stack with a minimum number of keystrokes. The stacks could be developed for a utility, transarea, or region, would contain load data, and would be capable of incorporating real-time information to provide fundamental insight and market advantage. At this point in the process we are looking for ideas (and sponsors). If you think your traders might be open to the idea, I would like to talk to you and them about it, and potentially as early as next week. Please advise. Thanks, Eric\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I want to remind you that recommended conference attire is business casual. If you do not have a Stanford parking permit (either by mail or at your hotel), please drive to the conference facility, park, and obtain one at the meeting room. Detailed directions can be found on the website but here is a summary from Highway 101 North & South: Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university. Stay in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus. At the four-way stop, turn right onto Campus Drive. Take first left (Lasuen Street) and drive to the end and park. Conference site is at this building. If you do not yet have a parking permit, we will give you one there. I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting. Hill > ******************************************************************* Hillard G.

Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow all presentations are due as I will be in and out of the office for the rest of the week at the Asset and Liability Management conference. If your presentations are not ready, for whatever reason, please send me an email to notify me and I will send you a headcount as to how many copies of your presentations to print. You will need to take them to the training course yourself. Please remember that you will need to bring your own laptops as we do not provide them. Spyros, I believe you are to inquire with Peter to see if you can use his. Also, I am under the impression that the presentations submitted for the London training course, will be the same ones to be used in the New York and Houston Financial Mathematics training courses. Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know by when you will have presentations ready for those particular courses in those locations. Should you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me. All the best and I look forward to meeting you soon. Joanna\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I work for a start-up company, which offers ASP-based treasury management software. We currently specialize in f/x and interest rate derivatives, and we're looking to extend our product portfolio into commodity derivatives and/or cash management. As part of my market research, I'd like to speak to a few key people to get a better understanding of the treasury management needs of companies that use energy derivatives. Might you be able to either give me a few minutes of your time or give me the name of someone else to talk to? Please find attached some general information about our company. << File: 4para.doc >> I look forward to your response.

As you pointed out this is in our mutual interest aswell as the interests of much of the Houston business community. I mentioned in our meeting the possibility of your joining the Council ofOverseers of the Jones School. This group consists of about 36 businessleaders, mostly from Houston but also includes individuals from as far awayas Saudi Arabia. We meet about two times a year for an afternoon to discuss important policyissues facing the Business School. I have found the advice and counseloffered by the group to be extraordinarily helpful as we work on improvingthe Jones School. The group is chaired by Dennis Hendrix, former CEO ofPanEnergy. I will fax you a list of the members and the charter of the group. It so happens that we will be meeting next Wednesday afternoon from threeto five PM at Cohen House, the faculty club at Rice University and youwould be welcome to attend either as a new member or as a guest.Interestingly, a presentation will be given by a group of faculty who haveinterests in the area of e-commerce. I will have my assistant fax this material to you shortly. Should you wishto discuss this, I will be here all afternoon today as well as all of nextweek. gil\nAnswer: not sensitive"

They will have the capability to output from S-VHS, Beta SP and electronic sources, along with minimal editing and creation of basic multimedia images suitable for the Enron channel. Additional costs would be incurred by individual departments incrementally as they produced video content for the monitors. Enron would then have a choice of vendors, including the in-house graphics group, Innovision (Beth Stier) and others. We also need to determine the point of demarcation for the \"head-end\" of the video signal for these and any other building monitors. I don't know if your estimates include any of this head-end equipment which would include VTRs, modulators, distribution amplifiers, CATV contracts and receivers, satellite, etc. Regardless, we need to talk to the folks who will be producing content for these monitors to see what types of capabilities they want to have. Finally, someone will have to \"own\" the channel and pre-approve content for distribution. I'm pretty certain that Mark Palmer wants to control the content, though I don't think that he wants to manage the production group, or create any overkill. I'd be happy to discuss alternatives with all of you for the content side of this project. Again, I think that the costs will be incremental expenses related to creating content rather than capital outlay. Beth, Mark, Pam, Setev, Terrie, et al. - Are you interested in addressing what in-house capabilities you'd like to have with me?\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Will try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, attractive look. Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept. such that we know total costs are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants). We have a 3 month implementation schedule. Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc. Let me know next steps. We can discuss funding sources. - Bill\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I write at this time for two reasons. First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, Iremain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present atthat EPRM Financial Math course. I wanted to advise you know that, inaddition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner atthe home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30. Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write toremind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointlyattending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17. Per the Astros'schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nightsfor a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field. Let me know if either7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective. Hope all is well. Best,Ehud\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I spoke with Iris last week about something she had submitted to you. It's about the various models that we've created in the department. She said that it goes into details we may not want to publicize, but that it might be adaptable for the newsletter. There's an introductory section, a models section, and recommendations for the future. I would suggest that we run the introduction, amend the models section to eliminate anything we don't want to say, and omit the final portion. If you are agreeable, I can use all or part of the introduction in today's issue and split up the rest. It would give us a breather while others are finishing their submissions. What do you think?

The people in my organization support all the Enron business units but many are specifically dedicated to certain business units. As a consequence, we have ended up on a variety of LANs with a variety of support people. Due to the fine efforts of your team, many people in my group have migrated over to the Enron Corp LAN. We are also now enjoying great support from Russell & Russell (Servat and Mitchell). As the IT guy, I'm sure you are accustomed to such profuse praise.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Ordinarily, I would be happy toparticipate. However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) onOctober 1. Judging from the last time she went through this I will have tostay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10. Too bad. On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company toget in touch with me? I would like to set something up with MIT'sexecutive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, includingenergy purchases and management. We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas andelectricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an evergrowing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computerfacilities and laboratories. I'm sure that we can do it more efficientlyand I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities toout-source some or all of these activities. I would like to put them intouch with someone at Enron. Thanks Paul Professor Paul L.

Note: it is booked the week of June 24th. > http://www.rentavilla.com/property_detail.asp?ref=IT-TUS-011-03 This is an apartment, similar in decor to Pastore, very nice pool and location. > http://www.rentavilla.com/property_detail.asp?ref=IT-TUS-003 This is a property that I strongly suggest as it is an independent villa with pool, excellent for a family with children. The price is a little higher and the furniture are modern, but the privacy is guarantied! > http://www.rentavilla.com/property_detail.asp?ref=IT-TUS-020-02 This is an independent house near San Gimignano. The pool is shared with the main villa. Please, be advised that our rentals are from Saturday to Saturday (in this case from June 17 to July 1). Hope to hear from you soon.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

All he needs to do is approach the front Reception Desks and asking for entry. The receptionists will recognise Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through - without delay - by lifting the adjacent rope. We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers, as per standard procedure, when he is entering the building by himself. We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems/data base @ the Reception Desk, to make it easier on a visitor of any employee. For example if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is expected, the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the sign in process. The guest simply has to exchange their business card for the visitor pass. Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception Desk and asks that their guest gain entry, that guest can get a badge without signing in. Again, we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a visitor pass. We are working on installing a new data base @ the Desk that will pull up a digitised photo of the employee (duplicate of what's on their badge) on the screen. This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without showing other ID and will speed process. Finally, we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be a duplicate back-up for executives. It is sized to fit on a key chain and works with our standard card readers. - Bill\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Daniel Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment. Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate America collects, uses, and protects valued information. In addition to explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include \"hypothetical\" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) to illustrate his points. This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls (CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal. This event kicks-off CABC's Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of competitive intelligence. This particular speaking engagement is designed to raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information. I believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age. All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects of serious competitive intelligence. Select executives like yourselves are being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that you think might benefit from attending this event. The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor Conference room. Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell. Hope to see you there. P.S. By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the \"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),\" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

The description will start with People\\ or Room\\ unless it was entered manually at the source.Data connections: One connection is being charged for each room instead of one connection for each port in a room. Attached are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services. EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC. For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose. People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service. EIS bills services on a one month lag. We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee. This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information. Please examine these billings for accuracy. If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative. If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The intranet site will be placed on the home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your California Power Issue needs. The database has been populated with the latest information that I have received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has then been broken down further into subcategories. The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have access to this information. The secured document section contains all the information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these documents should not be restricted. To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go to this link: http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf (It is best if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape browser.) Once you are at this site you will be able to access all articles and information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, go to this link and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter your new network password.) There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-4382. Thanks, Gavin\nAnswer: sensitive"

Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The further development, implementation and ultimate success of this effort will depend upon the participation and coordination of the business units and regions. To that end, we are launching a Corporate Responsibility task force, which I will chair. The roles of this task force will include developing and coordinating social and environmental policies, strategy, and information among the Enron business units; monitoring alignment of business activities with corporate responsibility goals; and providing a forum for business units to share issues and develop a consistent strategy. Kelly Kimberly, Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, and also of Marketing Communication and Public Relations for Enron Broadband Services, will lead the overall corporate responsibility initiative. Additionally, because of their interest and experience working on these issues, Paula Rieker, Mark Schroeder and Rob Walls have already volunteered to represent their respective business units on the task force. As a leader at Enron, I am seeking your participation, support and leadership. I am asking the head of each business unit or major corporate function to either participate personally or designate a VP-or-higher level individual to serve as a member of the task force. I look forward to your organization=01,s participation. The first task force meeting will be in Houston from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Please choose one of the dates listed below, note your designee, and respond to Stacy Walker by Tuesday, September 19, by fax at 713-646-3248, or by phone at 713-853-3583.

H.R. 4908 is sponsored by Subcommittee ChairmanCharles Canady (R-FL-12) and cosponsored by subcommittee member Bob Barr(R-GA-7). The bill would require employers to notify employees aboutelectronic monitoring. The National Association of Manufacturers urges itsmembers to notify their employees about internal monitoring practices.Nevertheless, H.R. 4908 is being placed on a fast track that could allow formany unintended consequences. The NAM urges you to contact the Subcommitteeon the Constitution at (202) 226-7680 and subcommittee members (see below)to urge postponement. Message: The September 6 hearing on H.R. 4908 was not well advertised and did notinclude the views and concerns of employers. Because of the nature of computers and other electronic equipment, any\"electronic monitoring\" bill has to be carefully written so that it does notinterfere with other fiduciary and legal responsibilities of employers. This is far too important an issue to \"rush through\" the process. For more information, call Larry Fineran at (202) 637-3174 or e-mail him atlfineran@nam.org.Subcommittee Members: Charles Canady (R-FL-12), Chair -- (202) 225-1252Henry Hyde (R-IL-6) -- (202) 225-4561Asa Hutchinson (R-AR-3) -- (202) 225-4301Spencer Bachus (R-AL-6) -- (202) 225-4921Bob Goodlatte (R-VA-6) -- (202) 225-5431Bob Barr (R-GA-7) -- (202) 225-2931William Jenkins (R-TN-1) -- (202) 225-6356Lindsay Graham (R-SC-3) -- (202) 225-5301 Mel Watt (D-NC-12), Ranking Member -- (202) 225-1510Maxine Waters (D-CA-35) -- (202) 225-2201Barney Frank (D-MA-4) -- (202) 225-5931John Conyers (D-MI-14) -- (202) 225-5126Jerry Nadler (D-NY-8) -- (202) 225-5635\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

Hamd Alhkayat--Hamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's speeches. Shelley Corman--Shelley has been developing messages for the current and anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group. (The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.) Stinson Gibner--Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic futures pricing. Gil Muhl--Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk. His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter volatility. I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the meeting. Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an overview of the situation as the \"teacher\" or \"professor.\" Some questions that you could address would include: Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned? How is the business different today? What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history? I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting before and after your keynote is that you have \"been there\" in the evolution of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers deal with price and supply uncertainty. There is also a good opportunity to stress the need for new industry \"best practices\" (more hedging) and the right public policies to deal with this issue (from \"do no harm\" to expanding incentives in the market). - Rob\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I would appreciate it if those of you with more first-hand information, particularly Wanda and Diann, correct or clarify anything I've misstated. Also, please forward this to anyone else with an interest in this matter. A. Recoupment of the PX Credit (also known as the \"Negative CTC\") 1. Background: The issue here relates to the fact that PG&E and SCE are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers. Prior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March, the bills would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to T&D charges. SCE and PG&E have now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us for T&D, despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in PX Credits. This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opinion of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be collected as a bill credit, and not in cash. Mike Day, our regulatory lawyer, expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was improper, and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with the CPUC. Note: the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which accrued to prior to December 31, 2000; the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrued during that time frame, and there is no dispute as to the proper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame. Furthermore, PG&E and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that had accrued as of December 31, 2000. 2. Action Items/Issues: (a) With respect to SCE, Legal is evaluating filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC. The CPUC has a process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our customers while the issue is being determined (by depositing the payments in an interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC); while there is no equivalent procedure in federal court, one can request that the court enter an injunction against the utilities disconnecting customers. While the analysis is worth doing, I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the CPUC for relief. (b) With respect to PG&E, the banruptcy team is evaluating whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court. 3. Timing: Late fees will begin accruing August 20. The first disconnect notices would not be received until September 19. 4. Effect on other CTC issues: Pursuing action at the CPUC or in court to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effect on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and prospectively. B. $10 Surcharge 1. Backgound: Although when provisionally imposed in January the $10 surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent, when made permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWR's purchases of power on behalf of the utilities. This evolution gives rise to two bases for EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the $10 surcharge. First, since the $10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing generation for bundled customers only, and not direct access customers, direct access should not have to pay it. This is the same logic that caused the CPUC to exempt direct access customers from the $30 surcharge.Secondly, if legitimately applied to direct access, because it is of no direct benefit to direct access customers it (arguably) can only be viewed as a tax. Under EES's contracts with its customers, taxes assessed at the delivery point are borne by the customer. Note: SCE, unlike PG&E, may not impose the $10 surcharge on direct access customers, according to a filing made at the staff level at the CPUC, so this action may relate to PG&E only. 2. Action Items/Issues: (a) Regulatory (Jim Steffes) has the lead in advising us about a challenge to the application of the $10 surcharge to direct access customers at the CPUC. It may be advisable for an industry group rather than Enron to make the filing. (b) I would expect that we would follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with the CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected. In the interim we would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if our challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is successful. (c) A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 when the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was first imposed. 3. Timing. Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect notices. 4. Effect on other CTC issues: Regulatory (Jim Steffes) will analyze with the appropriate people the effect, if any, of taking this position on other CTC issues (principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and prospectively).

I think you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with Schroeder re: Littlechild. Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range). I had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost of providing gratis. I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am surprised to see it turn up in print. Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is. In fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one but that we're always interested in working together. Best,Jeff\nAnswer: sensitive"

Call bob Badeer with questions about the BEEP as I am heading out of town in a couple of hours. Tim: I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be, but it ain't quite there. So I'd rather keep our powder dry and use Skilling at another time.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you couldhelp us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one ofour panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of ourelectricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspectiverepresented. Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity aboutthe conference will be going out shortly. A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me knowif you need any additional information. Thanks very much for your help and advice.Lee The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC'sEnergy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-levelsummit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the Californiacrisis. The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. TheUniversity will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange betweenexecutive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators. The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and amoderator. During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in adebate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, wherewe have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on thehorizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&Aand discussion. We expect a live audience of about 200, including a largepress presence. One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internetstreaming video services. We hope to have a balanced group of sponsorsranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies. The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminaryacceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricityregulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of EconomicAdvisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School ofBusiness). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.Representative EdwardMarkey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and statelegislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of thepanels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professorof Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility ReformNetwork (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. LeeFriedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide anintroduction to the panel discussions with his talk \"Lighting the Stage: TheElectricity of Deregulation.\" A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's GoldmanSchool of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We havereserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel.

The EEF is an international leadership exchange program that promotes international understanding and productivity through the exchange of information, ideas, and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the world. Ken Lay is a member of the EEF Board of Trustees. Enron will be hosting three EEF visitors from India on Wednesday, October 18, 2000: Mr. Sanjeev Ahluwalia, Secretary of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission; Mr. Sreenivasan Jain, Newscaster, New Delhi TV; and Mr. Jawed Usmani, Joint Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister. I am preparing a day program at Enron for the three persons, two of whom - Sanjeev Ahluwalia and Jawed Usmani - are interested in learning more about the US regulatory environment. Mr. Ahluwalia also wants to learn more about US environmental policy in both local and global contexts (please refer to attached bios for more details). I would be grateful if either Steve or Jim could meet with the above persons for 30-45 minutes to discuss regulatory issues. Similarly, if Mike could be available to meet with Mr. Ahluwalia re environmental issues. Please let me know if you are available either between 10:00 - 12:00 noon or 3:30 - 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, October 18, 2000. If you are unavailable, it would be appreciated if one of your other colleagues could assist in this regard. Many thanks, Johan - AHLUWALIA bio.doc - CV1.doc\nAnswer: sensitive"

(EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas. We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer. There were a rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Attached is a memo we handed out to employees, but basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities. The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago. In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL, we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages. We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001. 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms. We told them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a PSA with a buyer. However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within Enron. Those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer. I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible. Last year when we were for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know. If anyone in the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week. Mike Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878). He is fully briefed on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL. Mike will be traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday. I will be available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713. I would suggest talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible. This afternoon I notified our partners and thr Gov't of India of our intention to market our assets. I will be making a trip to India soon to visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two weeks. While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me. As you might expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these groups. I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.

In addition, we are presently trying to schedule you with Senators Lieberman, Landrieu, Hagel, Domenici, Johnson, and Cantwell. You will be here at a very important time. In addition, Ken Lay is slated to be in New York on June 15. We are trying to get appointments for him with Senator Schumer and Rep. Rangel. If we are unsuccessful in lining up anything for him in NY, we have \"penciled in\" Ken on Chairman Bingaman's calendar for 10:30 am that day, here in DC. Ken is in NY Thursday night for an award, and I understand is planning to be in NY Friday night, but his calendar at present is clear during the day. If we don't get the Schumer appointment in NY, I will being asking you to see if Ken is willing to make a quick trip during the day on Friday to DC to see Bingaman and, if we can get him, Leader Daschle. I think it would be worth a quick trip from NY and will still allow him to be in NY that night.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC. Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments please respond to him by May 25, 2001. Dave Delainey Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC. We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. The actions points from this excercise are: 1 to review and agree the attached mapping 2 consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them as indicated on the attachment. 3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation. Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25. To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings. Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of reference.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Here are notes for your staff meeting. Buyer/Seller have executed Offer Letter on Falcon EX ($32,750,000 price). Aircraft goes to pre-purchase inspection this weekend. Close is no later than June 6th. All indications are that buyer is very motivated to complete the deal.Enron Center South (ECS) Project remains solidly on track. We are 10 weeks out on initial occupancy with Level 3 occupancy (EGM moves Aug. 3rd). Levels 4 (EIM, ENW, & Credit.Com) occupies two weeks later (Aug. 17). Level 5 (Power) occupies two weeks after (Aug. 31st - Labor Day weekend). Level 6 (Gas) occupies two weeks after (Sept. 14th). Level 7 (Executive) and the 1st floor public spaces occupies year end. Level 2 (Cafeteria) opens Nov.Found a Law firm interested in Azurix's present space in Three Allen Center (3 floors). Goal is cut deal and have them in by year end.Enron Broadband indicates an intent to remain on their present ECN floors (Levels 44 and 45), plus backfill balance of operations into Wholesale's vacated trading floors. This splits them into two elevator banks and becomes problematic for ETS - who wants continuous floors, ECN Levels 39 through 46.We are seeking subtenants for Broadband's Portland office space. They plan to vacate the Riverplace building by Oct. Negotiating new food service contract with Sedexo Marriott to add ECS cafeteria. Total compensation will be based on 3% fee on gross revenue - only on individual sales of $2 or more (promote greater # of meals served) and bonus based on sharing of net operating income with Enron. Global Sourcing is participating with us in negotiations.Need to decide if Executive Car Care program is going to be continued (30 executives participate with employee paying $70 per month and business units subsidizing $275 per month). Decision needed because new Garage will require $60K in improvements to get set up for car washing. Present lease on remote car washing facility (@ $5k per month) expired and we are on month to month holdover.We are two weeks out to close on Beltway 8 land deal ($1.7 purchase price). Real estate being acquired for construction of new $18 mill. Data Center and Disaster Recovery Facility. Phillipe and I meet with Frevert next week to get approvals. - Bill\nAnswer: sensitive"

For the speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of energy development. Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the commission is charged with the development and promotion of such. But the Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters in the traditional sense. We will continue to have the status of a colony if we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are evolving. If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role in this evolution. I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a short Qand A period. But your message can be as succint as you can make it and get the point across. You may have to present the Enron case a number of different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point. You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address role playing by the state and the commission. Plan to join us for lunch. If you need more detail, let me know. Thanks! Stephen\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I mentioned to Linda about my discussion with you and she said she would very much like to share with you what is going on in EES. Linda was one of our best employees.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team. It soundslike there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee. My big issue is default service. This industry needs real customers andthe only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service. Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gasmodel, is the best way to go. The only way to sell this, however, is toget the big customers to agree it's a good idea. J.

I serve as Chairman of the VMA's EnergyResources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and theday-long agenda it will entail. As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or anotherkey individual, the VMA is offering Enron an opportunity to participate inits seminar in an important way. We seek to have Enron speak on thesubject of the developing competitive market and how that market may beaccessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many,if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia. The purpose ofthe seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able,under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passedin 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1,2002, and by no later than January 1, 2003. The subject is becoming a highpriority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues todaygenerally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available toVirginia customers. We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members whotoday hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminarparticipant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives inCalifornia and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospectsfor successful competition and effective choice in Virginia. Enron couldhopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers oncethe day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform,aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrellaorganization, is considering), and related topics. The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possibleEnron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:00pm. Weexpect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offerattendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislatorsand others who have been closely involved with the development of theVirginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years orso. I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and againthank you for your assistance. I will be happy to discuss the particularswith you or anyone else, should that be helpful, and can be reached atAEP's state office in Richmond at 804-698-5511.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

If you are not familiar with BGS, a member must be in the upper 5% of their class as a junior and the upper 10% as a senior and in graduate school to be nominated for induction into the society. In an effort to provide additional programs and benefits to alumni members, alumni chapters are being developed around the country. There are currently nine alumni chapters around the U.S. with a new one being formed in the Houston area. I am serving on a steering committee for the development of this Houston Area Alumni Chapter. Our primary reasons for starting a Houston Area Chapter include networking, professional affiliations, outreach to students, resources, learning opportunities, and providing scholarships. Our initial outreach to Beta Gamma Sigma members will be through a reception/dinner to be held in October 2001. We are currently looking at either October 16 or 18. All 6,200 Houston area members will be invited to participate, however, we expect attendance to be closer to 75-100 people. The ages, experiences, and business affiliation of the members will be very diverse, but all will have the common thread of business excellence. The details of this event are still being finalized; however, at our last meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics. Overwhelmingly the team decided on Electricity Deregulation in Texas, and since I work at Enron, I was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker. Cliff Baxter suggested that you would be an ideal speaker on this topic. Are you available and willing to address this group in October? If I can provide any additional information, please let me know. Thank you for your consideration, Steve.\nAnswer: sensitive"

(necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's internal email system) Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared drive that has been set up for this specific purpose. Note: AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are questions, or the data needs updating. We should also consider the sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being distributed electronically. Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info back and forth. Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info: A secured folder has been set up on the \"o\" drive under Corporate called Arthur_Andersen (O:\\Corporate\\Arthur_Anderson). Please post all confidential files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email address. If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/. Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants). Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing. Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day. Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices. Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic. It's attached. Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics. Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling. Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Thanks so much for working on getting us the right person from Enron to be a panelist. The details of the event are as follows:----------------------------------------------------5.3.01 ePanel=02!eEnergy: Evolving Trends in the Deregulation of the Electric IndustryThe U.S. electric industry is undergoing a sea change in the way it delivers electricity to millions of households and businesses nationwide. The $220 billion industry, which has been called the last great government-sanctioned monopoly, is slowly but surely being deregulated and opened to competition, giving consumers the power to choose their electricity provider in much the same way they choose telephone carriers.Deregulation, now scheduled to occur on January 1, 2002, is coming to Texas and with it comes the power of choice for most Texans. Just like you can choose your phone or cable provider, you will soon be able to choose your electric provider. Panelists include:Waters Davis, President, Reliant Energy Retail ServicesBrett Perlman, Commissioner, Public Utilities Commission of TexasTime:4:45 =01) 5:15 Private reception =01) panelists, Texas eComm Members and media5:30 =01) 6:00 Check-In6:00 =01) 7:15 ePanel Discussion7:15 - Networking----------------------------------------------------Also, We were planning on hosting this event at Dynegy, however they are unable to accommodate our request due to scheduling conflicts that were unforseen. We were hoping that Enron would consider hosting the event and allow us to use your auditorium in light of this new development. Please let me know if this is a possibility.

I think we should refer these to Carrie Robert and ask her to run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest. In this case, I would get in touch with Andy Fastow, Ben Glissan or someone in the finance group in London. That way, we can make a better determination about the value of the relationship, make sure those who are interested in pitching them on doing bus. with Enron can be involved. Or, we can make a determination to decline. I think we decide who we want to let in then do it for free, rather than charging.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review comments on the significance of recent developments for Enron.2. I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.3. I have asked Paul Portney to review \"the lay of the land\" in the environmental policy area.4. Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on this subject.5. I couldn't get anyone on the \"monopoly-too-big-and-powerful\" question, although I am still trying.I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply picture. Have we heard from the author of \"When Genius Fails\"?\nAnswer: not sensitive"

He has a small consulting services contract with me, to write on liberalisation of energy markets. his current work is devoted to, among other thins, debunking Joskow, et al., on the argument that most of the benefits of liberalisation are cpatureed at the wholesale level, and he argues that a working/funcitoning retail market, and corresponding contracts market for risk management, is paramount to ultimate success (very Enron). He comes across very much as an academic (Jeff Dasovich heard him speak on this subject in San Francisco, and he has spoken in Tokyo), and very Staid British, but he was electricity regulator in UK for 9 years, and is indisputably a top academic, so he carries some status when he speaks. i would hope that all 3 of you could make some time with him, and any toerhs you could think of.

Or shall I wait to hear from your successor?2. We spoke some time ago about a possible visit to Houston. I shall be in DC on Friday 20 April and Austin on weekend of 21/22 April. I thought of visiting on Monday 23 April if that would be convenient and if relevant people would be available. My main interest would be Enron thinking on US developments such as retail, California, trading, Pools versus bilateral markets, capacity auctions etc. Also Enron global strategy in other countries.I gather you're off on holiday now.

From your message I think there may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us. We understood that your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to as-yet-undetermined people, along with various Enron material. They also wanted to post it on Enron's public web site.But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your intranet - for educational use only for your internal folks. If this is correct, we would have no problem with it. In fact, we have posted the op-ed on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron employee for internal use only. If you want you could just post a link to the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research on the topic.If I misunderstood you, and you do want to redistribute the piece to third-parties -- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our intellectual property and branding issues. Obviously, we would need to talk some more about this. I hope this helps.On a somewhat-related note, we are also getting sucked more and more into the California vortex, and being asked to help in areas that are not our traditional business, such as expert witness testimony and policy issues. While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must maintain a neutral and independent posture. This is sometimes a difficult path to navigate, but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron:1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies. We are considering how best to broadcast our assessment, without impinging on our core business, or becoming an expert witness. We think a workshop, similar to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work, where we would present our findings and issue a report.2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West - especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy. This would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or university. Again the reults would go to our clients, but could be released to a wider audience, and a workshop might help highlight the release.Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron. We would need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort , but the work would be CERA's independent research and we would stand fully behind it.Hope all is well. ...Peter .\nAnswer: not sensitive"

There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the same page. As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA (Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium (details attached below). If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 1st Fortune 500 company to \"go green\" in its headquarters building. Couple this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging. We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd). The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for actual commodity. It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in our messaging. The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, and steps for moving forward. The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or someone from your group can attend. Stacey BoltonEnvironmental StrategiesEnron Corp3-9916\nAnswer: not sensitive"

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing. Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks. Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events. We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings. As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event. It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room. Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session. The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space. We request your authorization to move forward. As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room. Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.

Classify text among sensitive, not sensitive.\n\n---\n\nFollow the following format.\n\nQuestion: ${question}\nAnswer: The classification label, either 'sensitive' or 'not sensitive'.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Gentlemen: Situation: Emerson is aggressively seeking at least a three hour time slot for a meeting with Jeff Skilling in April or May 2001. Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation. Emerson is being persistent. The key players from Emerson are David Farr, newly appointed CEO, and James Berges, President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic development effort. It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting. Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior management, (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities, and (iii) hold a discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its current form. The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation. I need your advice and recommendation. Please respond by e-mail or telephone (x5-4040). Background: Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000, when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot, both Emerson VPs of Corporate Development, visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean. I met them at that time. Since that initial meeting, Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power business, I believe with promising results. My sense is that Emerson is uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business. I am waiting to receive an update from Martin. Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM business. While we generally support that idea, we are pressing Emerson to reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business. Emerson is highly decentralized, and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful. I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a proposal from EES's bundled outsource business. Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

Questions the report raises for Enron: Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance sector? Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks to IT systems. The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year. Discussions with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value. If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as $13K per year. An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the LLC's governance body to ensure Enron's needs were addressed. Archie Dunham, CONOCO's Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council recommends it at the 6 June meeting. Current coordination: The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO. Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative. Recent DOJ action regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that anti-trust will not be an issue. Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them. Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT protection efforts in next two weeks. Recommendation: Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector's efforts - As Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a \"one-stop-shop\" format is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

I have not spoken with Brian yet because I am waiting for a green/red light from Barbara as far as Jade Eaton is concerned. Barbara and I spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned about the counterparty's reaction to a meeting with DOJ (even an informal one). She plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me to get involved at this stage. I spoke to Rick as well so he is up-to-date with the current status. I'll let you know if anything further develops. Thanks again. Lara\nAnswer: not sensitive"

The press release provides: \"Theagenda will include \"unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power.\"Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors withoutthe presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s)).We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues todetermine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge oras evidence in any of the pending cases. Are any of your clients alsoconcerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and considerwhether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participantshould attend with its own counsel. Please let me have your thoughts andwhether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available toparticipate in a conference call. Thanks/ Jeffrey M.

When you stopped by my office, about 18 months agoyou asked if I had any students that might be appropriate foryour group. Although I didn't at the time, now I do. This student hasexcellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statisticsand a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academicyear. His dissertation research is on the investment behaviorof Independent Power Producers in the US. As a result of researchassistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very welland is familiar with the other ISOs. I think he would be an excellentmatch for you. The only problem is that he will probably have manyother options available. However, I definitely think he's worth a look.If you'd like him to send you a CV, please let me know. Thanks.

This obviously takes a lot of my time as well because of its importance, in some ways like you or Stan Horton, in terms of drivers of my P&L. However, Jose manages this pretty much on his own without much involvement from Houston (it is a local effort by its nature), which was the point I was making at the PRC. He has a good grasp of the commercial, regulatory and political elements of all of this and keeps them all balanced well. He is methodical and systematic (which can also be perceived as not especially dynamic), and English is really his second language, which may have hurt him in the PRC. He is on the job I would wager as much as 80 hours a week. Do we have anyone at his level with as much or more responsibility elsewhere in the company?---------------------- Forwarded by James M Bannantine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 10/03/2000 10:11 AM ---------------------------\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Unfortunately, that process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate. Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA. Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to be held the first week of Jan. I would like to handle all of these consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this discussion. I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process. Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the title change. Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest convenience. If you need my assistance with this please let me know. I apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions. Please contact me with any questions/concerns. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeanie Slone/HOU/ECT on 12/19/2000 09:21 AM ---------------------------\nAnswer: sensitive"

Elena's title is admin coordinator, and I know that Sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that Elena should also. Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work. I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah's duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad. If the latter is the case, we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66K). Please advise. Thanks,Anne\nAnswer: sensitive"

Please advise if I am missing something. I will withhold other comments for now, except to note that the draft was dated 13 March, and had a 14 day period before expiry (now passed), and will assume that that is an irrelevancy.

His move to Madelin's job is a lateral one from theindustrial goods side to the services side of DG-Trade. In the mid 90s, I worked with Herve quite a bit and found him to betrustworthy and conscientious. He was a pleasure to work with, and althoughwe will miss having Robert in the Services position, Herve is a goodreplacement. --- Tim Timothy J.

He is being succeeded by Herve Jouanjean with Michel Servozas number 2. Does anyone have biographical information on HerveJouanjean Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here formeetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI andJapaneese counterparts. Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energyinterest involved as members of Andrew's group and they have expressed nointerest in liberalized energy services. This would seem to be anopportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of theirinterests and possibly the drilling people. During the ISAC 13 meeting last week, USTR Peter Collins reported that theWTO Working Party Dealing With China's accession had expressed concern withthe recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions andin the case of energy services and possibly e-commerce there are pricecontrols. We were told that a number of law firms in Washington areopposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informedISAC 13 members should they have a view on price controls. Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the Chinaaccession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues. You need to let usknow if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controlsfor energy services and e-commerce services. Joe\nAnswer: not sensitive"

As we begin to look for Japanese employees and in particular, RA/GA resources it would seem to make sense to tap into the US Graduate Schools (eg Kennedy School, W Wilson School, etc).

At HBS we had two Japanese in our section that decided not to go back to their sponsoring company. Today one is working for BCG and the other Cargill.

Stella Chan (Director level) is one of 6 expats Apachi have seconded into our SK Enron JV in Korea. Because they all mobilized at the same time, Darrell Kinder and I put in place a rotation plan whereby some would leave early, some extend (so we didnt have everyone leaving the JV at the same time). Its worked well to date, and we've mamanged to keep the Partners happy with the moves/replacements. Bottom line with respect to the Project Summer moratorium (in my view) is that because Stella will be replaced she is no longer part of the 'intellectual capital' the buyer (or any future buyer) is seeking to retain, and so the move should go ahead.

She had shown some desire to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to start her search (six months prior). Stella's search was very quick and she has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry Kingerski, who works for Rick Shapiro, who works for Steve Kean. She has set a preliminary job switch for October 16, 2000. This does not cause me too much concern, for as you are aware Waymon Votaw who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to be Stella's replacement. The timing of this could work out real well. Please pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the next step with both individuals. Thanks Tony\nAnswer: sensitive"

Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returningto Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleasedto talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter. In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had anyquestions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I wouldhave asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does JoeHillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman whocurrently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and someneighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does shereport? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in theLegislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs? I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it'sclear that government relations are much more central to the work of Enronthan at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.Thanks again for your call, your courtesy, and your indulgence with thistardy line of questioning.

At that time, you had offered to get me in touch withsomeone in the Finance Division (?) at Enron to discuss similar topics. Iam sorry to bother you with matters such as this, but I am still veryinterested in a position with Enron and would like to follow through onthis offer, if you are still willing. As an aside, another contact gaveme the name of Rob Bradley and suggested that I get in touch with him. Idon't know if that is who you had in mind, or not. I am moving my wife to Houston next week, and will be available to meetany time from Friday, August 4 until Thursday, August 10. After that, Ileave for a conference in Seattle, but will back in Houston for one day onThursday, August 17th. As for my timetable (which at the time you had told me to keep youapprised of), I will continue in my position at K-State for the Fallsemester. After that, I'm a free man. I have a couple of academic offersfor temporary positions in the Spring, one at Rice and one at UT-Austin.The latter is very appealing, but would require my absence from homeduring the weeks. As such, I am still wide open beginning in January. In spite of the fact that I awoke at 3:30AM in order to get to theairport the day that I met Jim Steffes and you, I got a lot out of ourmeeting. I was very impressed with Enron and what you had to say, and amhopeful about future prospects with the company. I remain very interestedin a future position at Enron, and perhaps in Public and GovernmentAffairs (I hope I have that right). Thank you for everything. I hope that you had a nice vacation.

The course is cross-listed between the HaasSchool of Business and the Energy & Resources Group at UC Berkeley. Thesyllabus for the course is attached. We have 43 graduate students in the course, most pursuing a masters degreein business or energy & resources, though there are also a few PhDstudents. These are very smart students -- many of whom already haveexperience in the energy industries -- and we believe the course puts themin a position to immediately contribute to any energy-related organizationthat they would join. Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanentemployment starting as early as May. If Enron has openings that you wouldlike to advertise to these students, please send me the job description(or the URL for it)and I can forward it to the class list. Jim and I think this is a very strong class, and many of the students areinterested in making a career in either the business or the public policy side ofthe energy industry. We're hoping to provide the connections to help make surethey find the best job matches possible. Sincerely,Severin _________________________________________________________________Severin Borenstein E.T.

In other words, he doesn't see himself taking a long-term departure from Investor Relations, but possibly there are some skills he would gain in this job that would make him even more valuable in a future IR role. For example, when he was with El Paso, IR and PR were combined. He said that he would follow up with me this afternoon or Monday and let me know if he has interest in discussing further.

I realize that there is some concern that Wanda is a litigation threat, so for the purposes of soliciting legal advice and in anticipation of litigation, I am forwarding my recollection of today's meeting to you: Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as \"unfair and discriminatory\" treatment. When I asked her what she meant specifically (and did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she did not intend the legal meaning of those terms; rather, she, on a \"personal\" level, felt that the company should have treated her better. She mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron, that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory (because Sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the company.I described several options for her:Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization;Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick again)Take severence under the standard package;Take severence as a \"business reorg\" but consult with Enron for a period.At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't particularly happy about any of the alternatives), but at the end of the discussion expressed interest in the second option.A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints about how she had been treated. Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about job assignments. I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some insensitivity. I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated her unfairly.Wanda did complain about many things, but never once complained about her pay at Enron. Mary, these are my recollections from today. Do you have anything to add?\nAnswer: Sensitive"

He would be an excellent catch. However, I see a couple of significant problems. My guess is that Andrew is too senior for this position, particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force. Also, I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months, if then. We should fill this position immediately. We are already missing opportunities because this position is vacant. As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates. I am setting up time for Rick to interview these candidates next Monday. The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom Delay's office. Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican leadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of the substance of the energy portfolio. Drew has strong networking skills, which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills. The second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years. John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent. John left the Committee in 1992. Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills. John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years. I believe both candidates bring different but very strong talents to the job. I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate. I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot. That said, please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

She has been ranked a Category 1 during year-end 2000 and mid-year 2001 PRC. She is responsible for the financial modeling of all the greenfield project development opportunities being pursued by Origination. She has learned to articulate the banks' concerns with the projects and equipment to be financed within E-Next and other structures to both the originators and accounting. The successful effort Origination has had this year with developments has provided tremendous document flow which has allowed Catherine to develop her document review skills from both a financing and commercial perspective. The growth in maturity she has experienced driven by her deal flow has made her one of the core \"go to\" junior people in my group when a deal calls for financial analysis. She has been performing at the manager level for six months and is seen as a leader among the junior staff in the group.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version, even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting, or simply \"agree to disagree.\" ---------------------- Forwarded by John Shelk/NA/Enron on 08/02/2001 05:09 PM ---------------------------\nAnswer: not sensitive"

My memo does not take account of the suggestionsthat have been circulated in the last day or so. I've also attached amarked-up version of the 7/19 draft indicating our changes. I propose that we meet in Washington on Thursday, August 9, at 10:00a.m., with the goal of coming to closure on reliability legislation thatis shorter and less detailed than the language in the pending bills, butthat still preserves the essence of an industry self-regulatoryorganization. I am working on a location and expect to provide thatinformation tomorrow. I know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and thatschedules are already full, but schedules will become even moredifficult later in the month.

We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday. John To be sent to: All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan, all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals, Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom), Coal, LNG & Weather. We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities. However, while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure. Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?] Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market. We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market. [deleted text] Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather, Oil, LNG, Coal, and Shipping. We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan, Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan. The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets. Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron. The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year. The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan. We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman. Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London. By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business. These employees remain in Enron Credit , a part of Enron Europe. EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end. The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months. In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing. Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans, General Counsel in London. The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe. The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London. The IT, HR, Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shapiro in Houston. We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets. We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.\nAnswer: sensitive"

The council includes several prominent permanent members drawn from the business and academic communities, to which we add distinguished guests with expertise in areas of interest to us on an ad hoc basis. Several of our top executives attend these meetings. I am hoping that you might help us in two ways. Irwin tells me that your headquarters building is innovative and has many features that it would be well worth our while to know about and to study. Would it be possible for you to arrange a tour for a few of our executives, both from the US and the UK, say on the morning of October 30? Second, we understand from Irwin and from the press that you have done wonders in reinvigorating and revitalizing the BA staff. I am hoping that you might be willing to share some of the secrets of your success with us, perhaps at an informal buffet lunch at our new London headquarters on October 31, or at some other time on that day that might be more convenient for you. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on what you have achieved at BA, in a short time and in a tough market. Sincerely,\nAnswer: not sensitive"

This committee meets twice each year, along with invited speakers on subjects of interest to Enron. Top executives of our company do their best to attend. Starting on the afternoon of October 30, and concluding late in the day on October 31, we will be meeting in London. I was most impressed with your presentation at the Aspen Institute energy forum, and am hoping that you might consider joining our meeting to discuss \"Where do we go from here: how to preserve the momentum of deregulation after California.\" We would be delighted to cover business class travel costs and all other expenses incident to your trip to London, including hotel costs should you choose to extend your stay for several days. In addition, there would be an honorarium of $XXXXXX. Do try to join us: you will find the other speakers interesting, and London a delightful place in which to spend a bit of time.

This new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners. Additionally, the Enron Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments. The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge. These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions. Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of Enron Principal Investments. Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal Investments. This new business unit will report to an investment committee, consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick and the other members of this group in this effort. Jeff Skilling\nAnswer: not sensitive"

This new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners. Additionally, the Enron Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments. The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge. These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions. Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of Enron Principal Investments. Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal Investments. This new business unit will report to an investment committee, consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick and the other members of this group in this effort. Jeff Skilling\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Please review and provide comments and feedback by the end of the week (note: Ted and David, we have a conference call scheduled Wednesday for the three of us to discuss). Also, I'm sending to Price Waterhouse Coopers for their input as well - I need to spend more time reviewing what they sent on Friday to see if I've missed any issues we want to address. I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to \"cushion\" the reception. Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with: Dave Gorte, Bill Bradford and Molly Harris Sally Beck's group (Beth Apollo and James New) Treasury (Perkins and later, Despain) Internal Audit (Kilchrist) Legal (Sayre/Taylor) I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review. As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling). I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.

In the meantime, I would answer the question as follows: Enron will continue to focus its attention on the commercial, light manufacturing and industrial end user markets. Enron continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a couple of years ago (for example, the rising acceptance of online purchasing by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential markets). We believe, however, that the residential market opportunity is best pursued through a separate entity outside of Enron\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the \"gap financing\" fund.UNEP conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are quite interested in climate change business opportunities. Also it provided a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc. Discussions with participants in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with them directly on that).

California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.

Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a \"Who wants to be a Millionaire?\" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9. The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes. I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign. Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN! Other items: Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring and other activites during the year. Other Enron business units will choose other UW agencies to sponsor through activities. We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign. Do we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on August 9? We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us, the market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us, despite the overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation.3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks.4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San Diego-based, would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers, dairy industry, etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.

I understand that the RTO discussion is moredifficult in the absence of paper.

In order to meet the deadline for comments, I need to receive your comments no later than noon, August 28th. The best way to submit these comments is by red-lining the actual document. You can also review and download the entire UBP report, including the finalized chapters and the chapters \"out for comments\", on http://www.ubpnet.org/workshop/download.htm. Please feel free to contact me (712-366-3399 or pager 888-912-1426) if you have any questions. Thanks for your time and consideration.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

It doesn't address the real underlying problem -- that a \"reliability bill\" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem. Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for action next year. If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go out at all.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Here's the result: Kirk Johnson's September 26th article, Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation, leaves readers with the misperception that competitive electricity markets discourage conservation. True customer choice proves otherwise. My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine. One of these customers is a paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of homes. When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to do. As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and residential customers didn't hear a word about \"brownouts.\" The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the regulatory elite. It's proving true in Maine, why not give New York and other states the same choice? Dan AllegrettiEnron Corp. If you like it, send it to the Letters to the Editor section at the New York Times. The protocol is on the editorial page. Thanks for the quick response, Mark\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier' contractor. (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him today.) Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors. Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare affirmative action plans. In addition, we do not feel that we are subject to an OFCCP audit. Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1 and AAPs. Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any of this. Hoyt\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

We can communicate changes by email, or I'll be happy to arrange a short conference call. If possible, I would like to distribute this by Wednesday or Thursday of this week. After the four of us reach consensus, I suggest we preview Cindy (and maybe the HR heads) prior to distributing. You will note that based on conversations I had with Skilling last week (where he emphasized his desire that we have one program, rather than a fractured program by business unit), I have added a review of the business unit distributions to the final meeting where we discuss the top perfomers. I've also added Janet Dietrich (tent.) and another EES person (tbd) to the AA Committee, since they have a large group of AAs and no representation on the committee. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, and thanks for your help. Ted and Terry did all the hard work.

Similar letters were delivered by Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium. I have attached a copy of one of the letters below. All the questions are the same in each. I have drafted a response with the goals of: 1) Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without \"greenwashing.\" We have an already-published public \"statement\" on climate change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts and accomplishments to back up our statements. I think our letter can land in the stack that they consider \"positive\" responses, and not in the stack of non-responses or \"we don't care\" responses. 2) Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about \"Kyoto.\" I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful answers to the general themes of the letter. I have discussed this with many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to answer. I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be engaged in this important issue. 3) Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual meeting Q&A; Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report. Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can understand and use. With that said, I also believe that these messages should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying too far from the basics can be dangerous. We should designate one or two clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our response letter. There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds in the local areas. I am not opposed to doing so, but would again appreciate being able to review these responses before they go. Please let me know if you have other views. I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 if we can turn it around that fast. Thank you for your input and assistance and I look forward to your reply.

Mark - please let me know oncewe have spoken to the five senior managers in your group as we do not want to send this out until either you, Michael orI have spoken to them about this structure. Draft After nearly five years in London, Mark Schroeder will be returning to the US on April 11th to join the North American Coal Business with responsibility for origination in the utility sector. Under Mark=01,s leadership, his team has made significant contributions towards Enron Europe=01,s =01&first mover=018 advantage and its status as the leading new entrant in the liberalizing pan=01)European energy markets. We wish him well in his new commercial role. With Mark=01,s departure, the day-to-day management of the Government & Regulatory Affairs Department in Europe will rest with Peter Styles, Paul Dawson, Paul Hennemeyer, and Doug Wood. Nick O=01,Day will continue in his current leadership capacity in Japan. Each of these five individuals and their groups will now jointly report to the business heads and to Rick Shapiro, in the Government Affairs team in Houston. Rick Shapiro will continue to manage Government Affairs for the Americas. While the team members responsibilities will vary from time-to-time in response to shifting commercial priorities, as well as the need to support other Enron Wholesale Services' business units from time-to-time, the general areas of responsibility will be as follows: Peter Styles, based in Brussels, will continue to have responsibilty for our EU and Netherlands advocacy. Paul Hennemeyer will lead efforts in the German speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) as well as France and Belgium. Peter and Paul will report to Eric Shaw. While secunded to the commercial team in France, Philip Davies will address Nordic market issues on an ad hoc basis and also report to Paul on these issues. Paul Dawson will lead our UK, Spain and Italian power regulatory efforts as well as the gas regulatory work in the UK. Doug Wood will support the Continental Gas team and the Central and Southeastern Europe Origination efforts, while also addressing the UK Climate Change Levy. Doug's role in gas will continue to be to supplement, and not to supplant, the efforts of each of the team members' geographic responsibilities noted on the organisation chart. Paul and Doug will report to Richard Lewis locally. Nick O=01,Day will also continue to report to Joe Hirl in Japan. Other regulatory support provided by Mark Schroder will be addressed in another organizational announcement that will be sentout from Governmental Affairs in Houston. Attached is the revised organization chart that now reflects the Governmental & Regulatory Affairs organization in Enron Europe. John Sherriff & Michael Brown\nAnswer: sensitive"

I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received this morning at the White House energy \"messaging\" meeting. These are very close hold. Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone. Ed asked us to give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be giving them comments). After glancing at the TPs, the obvious missing point is open access. However, I am not sure we should be alarmed about that. There really isn't any policy in the TPs. This is a typical WH message document. Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access. Also, Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House outreach effort. Any thoughts? 2. I am faxing to you EPSA's summary of the generators meeting with Secretary Abraham. I am glad I did not attend this meeting. As you will see from the summary, there were three parts to the meeting: a) an exchange of policy views, both long and short term, b) discussion of how to maximize generator output in Calif; and c) a request that industry participate in a DOE reliability group. I don't see any follow up for Enron, outside of our normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials.

Comments welcome \"The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy. His decision was based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form. \"I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative \"anti-environment\" reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations. Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts of action regulate CO2 emissions.\" \"The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market. We are well-positioned through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management.\" \"A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint. Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way. If we're able to make meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx, SO2 and mercury -- and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on CO2 whether it is regulated or not.\" In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy and environmental problems. ----- Forwarded by Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron on 03/22/2001 05:55 PM ----- Rosalee Fleming 03/22/2001 11:16 AM\nAnswer: not sensitive"

PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal eBiz publication. I am working on a story about the recent issue with respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to President Bush's as well as the coal industry. I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher electricity prices causing problems similar to California. I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees. A quote from you about this issue would be great. I would also be interested in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2. Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Ann Schmidt (x54694)\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

In the Stip, we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets. My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion management. While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited, I believe that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk. In addition, I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want everything in their package. Sarah is out until Monday when we need to get back with PJM. Jim ----- Forwarded by James D Steffes/NA/Enron on 03/16/2001 03:24 PM ----- Sarah Novosel 03/16/2001 11:33 AM\nAnswer: Not sensitive"

Comparing Enron to Apples You may have noticed =01) or you may be asking why =01) industry analysts often compare Enron to Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs or investment banks like Chase Manhattan. We thought it was time to sort out any confusion between our businesses, just in case someone asks you to explain. Here's how we're different from those guys:w Enron provides physical delivery of energy products to customers =01) we are not just traders. Those guys mainly act as brokers and do not participate physically.w Enron proactively seeks to reform and create markets. Those guys simply participate and compete.w Enron extends its business model into new and deregulating markets, enabling high growth rates. Those guys are in markets that generate less aggressive growth rates.w Enron owns physical assets that provide consistent cash flow, such as our pipelines. Those guys do not have them. And if that's not enough, we think our employees are so much cooler than theirs.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

We agreed that I should draft a letter for Jeff Skilling to send to Mr Okuda. I have had a rethink and believe that as a matter of courtesy (Japanese style), it would be preferable in the first instance if the contact with Mr Okuda is done from chairman to chairman. Mr Lay's letter will serve as an introduction to Jeff Skilling, and will also permit Enron Japan to follow up directly with Mr Okuda's staff in Japan. We can then draft a letter for Jeff Skilling to confirm arrangements. I attach a draft letter for that purpose.

I am looking for some help in identifying the right person(s) at: EnronCorp., for an introduction of our software solution. Steven, if you couldtake a moment and point me to the appropriate contact I would greatlyappreciate it. Summary of eProvisioning: eProvisioning radically improves people's Time-To-Productivity bytransforming the disparate activities that allocate IT resources to peopleinto a secure and automatic process. Once provisioned, these resourcesremain digitally connected to each person as they move through the businesscycle and are dynamically updated as necessary. At the appropriate time,they are systematically, securely and automatically removed. Organizations that employ eProvisioning gain a competitive edge and accesscomplete security by ensuring that people are kept productive from day one,and are prevented from becoming counterproductive beyond the day they leave.In addition, by aligning their IT infrastructure with business priorities,organizations can effectively manage change across the extended enterprise,and better respond to emerging market requirements. eProvision Day One provides business and IT executives with the ability toquickly identify bottlenecks and maintain accountability of theeProvisioning process through comprehensive reporting and trackingcapabilities. As business relationships between organizations expand,Business Layers technology provides the framework for integration andinteroperability between eProvisioning partners - suppliers and serviceproviders, devices and applications - which are the digital foundations ofthe Internet economy. Please, if you could give me a few minutes of your valuable time or guide meto the right person to describe the significant benefits of what we offer.\" Web Site: http://www.businesslayers.com Demo-Site: http://demo.businesslayers.comUser: blayersPass: blayers Thank you for your time.

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest. Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi.\nAnswer: not sensitive"

A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy services\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc. This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad. Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce. I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today. Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated. Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.Joe PS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\nAnswer: sensitive"

Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is being scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 3. Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues. It also needs to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local power pool rules. There is a similar program being prepared in London. A meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further. Mark Haedicke\nAnswer: not sensitive"

Schedule is very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this morning, with some back-up info that I've included below. Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening for delivery to Sen. Brulte. It's of course confidential. Few points: I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would be appreciated.As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to \"wallpaper\" Sacramento with our proposed legislation.This email does not contain the legislation. Mike sent the \"final\" versions of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver to his office today the proposed legislation. Again, based on our call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will handle that end of things. Please let us know at your convenience to whom you've decided to circulate.This email does, however, include a \"summary\" of our proposed legislation. But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute \"to the world,\" or if we'll need instead to tailor some new language. I think we all agreed that we need a \"one pager\" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively.We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals. We didn't finalize that plan. Perhaps the Sacramento team could propose a plan to do that. Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition?We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative package/message. We're in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue. As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call. You note that attached to the email is a \"legislative fix\" to AB1X that could solve the credit issue and an attached set of \"taking points\" related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue: a PUC order clarifying that DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function. Accordingly, I've put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section (legislative solution) under the topic \"create a real competitive retail market in California.\" To the best of my knowledge, we don't have legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so. If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss. I can be best reached to day by pager at 888.916.7184. Thanks to all for helping pull this together. Best,Jeff ----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 02/16/2001 08:27 AM -----\nAnswer: sensitive"
