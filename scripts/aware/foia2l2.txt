[INST] Describe UK FOIA Section 40. [/INST]  Section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in the United Kingdom provides an exemption for certain types of information that are considered to be sensitive or confidential. This exemption is known as "section 40(2)" or "section 40(3)" depending on the specific circumstances.

Section 40(2) applies when the information requested is held by a public authority, but is not available for release because it is protected by one of the following exemptions:

* Exemption 1: Information that is protected by legal professional privilege (LPP)
* Exemption 2: Information that is confidential or privileged in the context of legal proceedings
* Exemption 3: Information that is confidential or privileged in the context of a contract or other agreement
* Exemption 4: Information that is confidential or sensitive in the context of a trade secret or commercial confidentiality

Section 40(3) applies when the information requested is held by a public authority, but is not available for release because it is protected by one of the following exemptions:

* Exemption 5: Information that is personal data and is protected under the Data Protection Act 2018
* Exemption 6: Information that is sensitive personal information and is protected under the Data Protection Act 2018
* Exemption 7: Information that is protected by the right to privacy and confidentiality under the Human Rights Act 1998

In both cases, the public authority is not required to confirm or deny the existence of the information, but must instead issue a notice stating that the information is exempt from disclosure under section 40. The notice must also explain why the information is exempt and provide details of any relevant advice or guidance that is available.
