[INST] What personal information is exempt under Section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act in the United Kingdom? [/INST] Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in the United Kingdom, Section 40 deals with personal information. This section provides exemptions to protect the personal information of living individuals. The following types of personal information are exempted under Section 40:

1. Personal data consisting of the address, telephone number, or other contact details of an individual.
2. Personal data consisting of the views or opinions of the individual.
3. Personal data consisting of the physical or mental health or condition of the individual.
4. Personal data consisting of the sexual life of the individual.

It is important to note that these exemptions are not absolute and will depend on the specific circumstances of each case. The public authority may still disclose the information if it is in the public interest to do so, or if the disclosure would not be likely to cause substantial distress or harm to the individual concerned.
