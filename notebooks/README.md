# Notebooks

These Notebooks are purely for development purposes with the project.
All final experiments were run through scripts.

* Dataset explores SARA
* Experiment, scripts_notebook, structexp, and personal_investigation explore early prompting strategies.
* Old Analysis analyses early exploration of deprecated prompting strategies.
* Few-shot is where we trialled how we would set-up few-shot.
* new_svm explores SVM upsampling strategy.
