He began by saying that he and several people from the Business School (Severin Borenstein, George Cluff) are planning an electricity deregulation mini-conference that sounds exactly like ours, and wanted to check so that we don't step on each others toes and perhaps can do it together. They even had October in mind for their timing. We are further along then they are, however.\n"," My first response to him was that because our event is alumni-initiated, I am not sure that they would want this to be other than a GSPP event. By the end of our conversation, we were discussing GSPP co-sponsorship with two other campus units: IBER and UEI. Neither are schools. Carl is Director of the Institute for Business and Economics Research, a campus-wide organized research unit (and Rich Gilbert assists in this). UEI is Severin's group, the university-wide energy research institute. Carl suggested that they could help with administration and perhaps some modest support if we do this together. Carl himself is on the Market Surveillance Committee of the ISO, and I think would hope to have some speaking role. He also mentioned Frank Wolak of Stanford as a speaker.\n"," I think it would be good to try and work out this co-sponsorship. It would mean allowing some of them (Carl and Severin?) into our planning group. There connections are probably very valuable to us, and they really are on the same wavelength.

In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.\n","Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).\n","Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under \"information required\" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:\n","(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\n","The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.\n","As to the \"timely basis\" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:\n","\"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.\n","The change is to add \"appropriate\" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of \"appropriate\" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like \"consistent with ...\" or \"promote competition\" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.\n","Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.\n","Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

All rights reserved. Copyright Cato Institute Spring 2001\n","THE FINAL WORD CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on \"negawatts\" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the \"Information Economy\" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. \"Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,\" Davis declaimed. \"Take\" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. Californians want to snatch that money back. \"Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,\" reported the January 31 Washington Post. \"They took the money and ran,\" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too. R J. O'Rourke is the Cato Institute's H. L. Mencken Research Fellow and is foreign affairs desk chief for Rolling Stone.

There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.\n","We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger.

Davis\n","Committee News ReleaseThe Committee on Energy and CommerceW.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin,? Chairman Chairmen Tauzin, Barton Urge Gov. DavisTo Respond Immediately to Inquiries \n","Washington (July 11) =01) House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis: July 11, 2001The Honorable Gray Davis Governor State of California State Capitol Sacramento, California 95814 Dear Governor Davis:  As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist California in resolving its energy supply crisis.? One of these measures was a temporary =01&safe harbor=018 provision, effective only upon the California Governor=01,s request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act.  During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held on the California electric crisis, including two hearings on draft legislation, Members of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge, even with written =01&agreements=018 for extended operation between state air officials and the powerplants.? Nevertheless, California officials testifying or providing information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary.  I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate.? On June 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against three electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero power plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emergency extended operation.? On the same day, the City and County of San Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against the three Potrero units.? All parties involved in the litigation strongly assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all available legal remedies under federal and state law.  The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal air permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars.? Understandably, as a result of this potentially huge fine, the operator of the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three generating units, even during periods of electrical emergency.? Thus, the mere filing of this lawsuit could have a near-term impact of the amount of power available in California.  Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substantial amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities in California could also be subject to similar legal action.? The California Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 megawatts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of operation.? In addition, several new units are being brought on-line this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment.? According to incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prior to this summer=01,s peak demand period.? These units may represent up to 2% of generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Stage III electric emergency.  Although presented with written requests for information from the Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could not or would not provide the Committee with precise information on units that may have been off-line due to permit limits, a projection of the number of generating units that will face permit constraints that could cause such units to be off-line, the amount of generation associated with these facilities, the possible impact of these units on system reliability, and additional information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operating under =01&modified=018 conditions. We believe that in the face of the pending legal action, it is even more important that such information be accurately and objectively determined.  As we mentioned above, over several months in the spring and early summer of this year, the Committee sought California=01,s support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of certain powerplants.? Regrettably, the Committee did not receive any support from your administration for such changes to the law, as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this letter.? Instead, witnesses representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary -- even if it could only be granted during periods of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).?  It appears now that citizen groups in California -- as well as the City and County of San Francisco -- do not believe that the actions taken by you, your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal.? The pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previously claimed granted sufficient legal =01&flexibility=018 to keep these units running during times of emergency.? It is time, then, to reconsider this issue.  So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critical situation and respond accordingly, we would ask for your consideration of the following: (1) We would urge you to reply fully to the Committee=01,s earlier requests that CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act.? We should have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk. (2) In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are now being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act, we ask whether you will now favor creating in federal law a limited, environmentally-neutral safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to EPA. (3) Finally, we would ask that if you support such legislation, that you work with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this summer.  Thank you in advance for your consideration of our requests.Sincerely,W.J.

In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed.\n"," I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support.\n"," I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation.

I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.\n","1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. \n","2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.\n","3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.\n","I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.\n","Wade\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .\n","  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that  commodity price.\n","  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.\n","  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to  schools and hospitals.\n","  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.\n","  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the  rate-cap measure is \"deeply flawed\" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or  December 2003.\n","  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through  December 2002. \"It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,\" he said because it \"creates  tremendous uncertainty\" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance  new projects such as a new transmission line.\n","  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that  review the plans. \n","  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Davis To Respond Immediately to Inquiries   Washington (July 11) - House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis:  July 11, 2001 The Honorable Gray Davis  Governor  State of California  State Capitol  Sacramento, California 95814  Dear Governor Davis:              As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist California in resolving its energy supply crisis.  One of these measures was a temporary \"safe harbor\" provision, effective only upon the California Governor's request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act.              During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held on the California electric crisis, including two hearings on draft legislation, Members of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge, even with written \"agreements\" for extended operation between state air officials and the powerplants.  Nevertheless, California officials testifying or providing information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary.              I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate.  On June 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against three electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero power plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emergency extended operation.  On the same day, the City and County of San Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against the three Potrero units.  All parties involved in the litigation strongly assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all available legal remedies under federal and state law.              The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal air permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars.  Understandably, as a result of this potentially huge fine, the operator of the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three generating units, even during periods of electrical emergency.  Thus, the mere filing of this lawsuit could have a near-term impact of the amount of power available in California.              Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substantial amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities in California could also be subject to similar legal action.  The California Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 megawatts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of operation.  In addition, several new units are being brought on-line this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment.  According to incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prior to this summer's peak demand period.  These units may represent up to 2% of generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Stage III electric emergency.              Although presented with written requests for information from the Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could not or would not provide the Committee with precise information on units that may have been off-line due to permit limits, a projection of the number of generating units that will face permit constraints that could cause such units to be off-line, the amount of generation associated with these facilities, the possible impact of these units on system reliability, and additional information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operating under \"modified\" conditions.   We believe that in the face of the pending legal action, it is even more important that such information be accurately and objectively determined.              As we mentioned above, over several months in the spring and early summer of this year, the Committee sought California's support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of certain powerplants.  Regrettably, the Committee did not receive any support from your administration for such changes to the law, as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this letter.  Instead, witnesses representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary -- even if it could only be granted during periods of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).               It appears now that citizen groups in California -- as well as the City and County of San Francisco -- do not believe that the actions taken by you, your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal.  The pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previously claimed granted sufficient legal \"flexibility\" to keep these units running during times of emergency.  It is time, then, to reconsider this issue.              So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critical situation and respond accordingly, we would ask for your consideration of the following:  (1) We would urge you to reply fully to the Committee's earlier requests that CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act.  We should have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk.  (2) In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are now being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act, we ask whether you will now favor creating in federal law a limited, environmentally-neutral safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to EPA.  (3) Finally, we would ask that if you support such legislation, that you work with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this summer.              Thank you in advance for your consideration of our requests. Sincerely, W.J.

Due to press of other matters I will be brief.\n","First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  \n","Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.\n","Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  \n","Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. \n","Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.\n","Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  \n","Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.\n","Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.\n","P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.

We met at my request to discuss Barton RTO draft.  (The group EPSA meeting with Chairman Barton that was to have been yesterday afternoon has been rescheduled for next Tuesday.) Key points from the meeting -- 1.  They do not expect the Barton Subcommittee to mark up the electricity legislation this year.  Time is running out and Members of the subcommittee are not focused on the issue.  Instead, they plan to continue working on the issue at the staff level.  Probably will be another draft version circulated and then a version will be introduced by Barton as a formal bill by the end of the year. The earliest they see any kind of vote is late Jan. or early February. 2.   Barton feels strongly that FERC should not be the \"tail wagging the dog\" on RTO policy. 3.   On particulars of the bill, they are clearly reconsidering the 40,000 MW minimum threshold for the size of an RTO.  They are getting pulled in both directions, they say, and are inclined to drop the 40,000 MW number -- possibly leaving it to FERC to set a number.  They conceded that the mechanics of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month \"deadline\" for all transmission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick.  They consciously changed the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from \"arbitrary and capricious\" to \"preponderance of the evidence\" because they think otherwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC.  Spent a lot of time on how the draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall nature of the draft assumes there are only two parties to this -- FERC and the transmission owners -- while the rest of those truly affected -- from us to others -- are left out.  Sean said we could still intervene, but I said that was the truly pro forma aspect of their process since FERC's hands and our's would be tied by the \"rights\" given to transmission owners to drag their feet. Bottom line -- FERC has a window until next Spring without likely congressional interference, at least not of the formal, legislative variety, to both move on RTOs and improve its relations with Congress.

CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S.\n","  In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific  Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather  derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of  megawatt hours (MWh) sold.\n","  The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of  how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not  want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether  to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or  derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may  be used as an introduction to options.\n","  The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and  deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW.  Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability  distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability  distribution for the net operating contribution including the  contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives.  It is instructive for the students to think about what would be  the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent.  This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio.\n","  Specific learning objectives of these cases include these:\n","  - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial    innovation\n","  - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk\n","  - to challenge the students to value options where the    Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be    readily employed\n","  - to experience the perspective of top management in risk    management activities.\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

The USTR raised the issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session.\n","As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight.\n","Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request.\n","Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services.\n","She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you.\n","We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward.  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.  This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.\n","Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting.\n","The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.  I had planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us.\n","Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point.\n","These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.\n","Joe\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

All Rights Reserved\n","California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt torecover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , sayingthey may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate$43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed thisyear.\n","Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state isseeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-termcontracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment forDavis.\n","\"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people couldget us $8.9 billion,\" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a reportyesterday. \"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money.However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.\"\n","The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over aCalifornia settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sourcesclose to the negotiations.\n","Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today onthe amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannotreach a compromise.\n","\"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,\" Wagner toldreporters. \"In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point Imay offer a preliminary assessment.\" The settlement conference is set toconclude on Monday.\n","Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push bothsides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricingcontroversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 'slargest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury andput Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state'slights on.\n","Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn,chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power gridmanager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion inrefunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.\n","Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyersfor all sides, is closed to the public and media.\n","Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda,and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a \"joke\" that theparties might as well wear \"clown suits,\" according to a Dow Jones reportconfirmed by sources close to the talks.\n","But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led byReliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and SouthernCo., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. Thesuppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is ableto call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds,sources said.\n","Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC'scommissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, butnow is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 'selectricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higherrefund figure, some energy analysts believe.\n","Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part ofan overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state willhave to pay for energy under those deals.\n","California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failedderegulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases atvolatile \"spot market\" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer,so did the state's electricity bills.\n","In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff begannegotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion indeals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for amegawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over thenext 10 years.\n","That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state waspaying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- andconsiderably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade,energy analysts say.\n","A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve politicalpressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state'scontroversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue thatreducing future power charges that his administration negotiated shouldcount as a \"refund\" because the deals were reached \"under commercialduress,\" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.\n","Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.\"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,\" saidMichael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates.\n","The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a \"just and reasonable\"standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit,the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.\n","\"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,\"said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversightcommittee for the California grid.\n","Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room\"billions of dollars apart,\" as the talks approached their final weekend,sources said.\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

See below.\n","> http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/ A 1960 Moment Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democrats--and everyone else--something to cheer about. BY PEGGY NOONAN Monday August 7, 2000 4:26 p.m. EDT The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gore's running mate is so smart, so clever, so good, so satisfying, so striking that it just may turn this election a bit on its head for a while. Certainly its most immediate effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los Angeles, because now the Democrats, badly hit by their own form of Clinton fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their presidential candidate, have something to cheer about. They respect Joe Lieberman. They think he has a center, a moral and ethical view of the world. He is experienced and articulate. He is decent and intelligent. He is independent. The media love him. He is a regular co-star on Imus, and all of the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers, and all of the electronic pundits and anchors, know him and admire him. But that is not what is most wonderful. What is most wonderful is that he is an Orthodox Jew. What does this mean? It means a lot of people who love America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and great breakthrough has occurred. A friend, a journalist who is politically conservative and Jewish, e-mailed me to tell me he had been weeping all morning, that he'd cried when he heard the news. Another friend, a producer at a TV news show, called and told me she woke her father in California to give him the news and they both got choked up. \"This is like 1960,\" she said, and I said I know, and I got choked up. It is wonderful when America is at her most American, and breaks down another barrier and says \"What's in your heart is most important.\" If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee, and an Episcopalian, Al Gore would have been smart to pick him. He would have been an obvious choice. The only reason he would have hesitated over Mr. Lieberman is that he's Jewish. Mr. Gore decided that was just fine. I think that I have never seen Al Gore do such an elegant, intelligent and original thing. Well done, Mr. Gore. I have to tell you, this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me. I was a little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president, and I had gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Don't Elect Catholics to the Presidency. When it happened, it's hard to describe how exciting and moving and idealism-inspiring it was. It gave a lot of people a lot of joy. It opened things up more. That was a good thing. So is this. And because this is such a good thing, I hope everyone of whatever politics or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it. Everyone should be nice and not do any political bashing until . . . Friday. However, I think it's okay and maybe even helpful to note the following. Network producers are going to decide, in their bright and touchingly uninformed minds, that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be Christian conservatives. That's where they'll go for the negative sound bites. But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman. They've been arm in arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade. He was just about the only Democrat who'd give them the time of day. He was on their side. The last time I saw Mr. Lieberman was last spring, in New York, at a symposium on Hollywood and the culture. I moderated and introduced our guests--Joe Lieberman and Bill Bennett, who are close friends and co-warriors in the values battle. Lieberman and Bennett very frankly talked to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie stars about how to make television and film and music more decent, more helpful. This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr. Lieberman--as a good guy with his head screwed on right. Many conservative Christians--I think most conservative Christians--see all of those who love God as part of the same \"cultural minority.\" Conservative Christians don't feel they have much in common, in terms of their political desires, with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and such. But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews. They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative gathering; they crowd around Dennis Prager, Michael Medved, David Horowitz and scores of others. One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians is an Orthodox Jew called Dr. Laura; the last time I saw her she was wowing them at a born-again Christian assembly at the National Prayer Breakfast last February. A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that there's \"no upside\" to the Lieberman choice. I told him there's no downside. He was surprised and said, \"He can't even campaign on Saturdays!\" I said so what, America would love to see a politician who actually put God first one day a week. I wish I'd added this: Remember Sandy Koufax? Joe Lieberman not campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur. There were a lot of great sports moments in the 1950s and 1960s, but none greater than the day in 1965 when Mr. Koufax put God before the World Series. What a great guy, what a lesson for a generation of Christian and Jewish kids. And Muslims and everyone else too. Yes, it's good news for Hillary. It's great news for Hillary. It enlivens part of her New York base, it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are the party that did this great thing, it excites people--and may help them forget, or at least not remember so vividly, that the Democratic senatorial candidate has, shall we say, a not fully satisfying relationship with New York's Jews. A historic choice like the Mr. Lieberman can overwhelm a lot of previous bad static. But let's not care about that for now. The headline is not \"Is It Good for Hillary?\" The headline is: \"It Is Good for America.\" It is a wonderful country that does something like this, that takes a good man who is a member of a small ethnic/religious minority to be one of its two major vice presidential candidates, and that greets that choice with resounding hurrahs. This is really a great day. We should all be happy. We really are a maturing democracy.\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

For example, the Texas insurance code has evolved from a vague \"duty of good faith & fair dealing\" standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing certain things detrimental to the insured.  Justin tells me English law, in this regard, consists only of precedential case law, but it still could be helpful.  Because of the commercial risk (outside the ambit of arbitration in the instance) it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United India from withholding this information which is critical to running these machines.   If, in fact,  there truly is a 50% chance of failure in these machines, yet they won't share that evidence with us, this is a commercial risk DPC can't afford, regardless of coverage and apart from the arbitration.  (I'm wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today).  Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction, United India did us the favor of bringing  suit in London Commercial Court earlier, and thus having availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirst's emphatic witness statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction, I think it is worth considering  if they continue to refuse to give us the report in response to Justin's latest correspondence.  I don't think we can afford to sit on our hands on this one.  Why don't you and Neil kick this around, (since you don't have enough to do already).Cheers,Michelle\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis.  However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., \"de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work.\"  Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the \"authors\" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course.  The analysis would not be a debate over \"To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc.\"  In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a \"Nixon goes to China\" scenario.  Please take a look at the list of participants.  Again, we can add to and subtract from the list.Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.)None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum.  It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan).The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project.

Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).  \n","As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it recessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions (Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.  What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation.\n","Lee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all non-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  \"we would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language\" (which includes favourable language on energy and metals).

Without structural incentives to go short into real time, I would expect the CAISO to \"inc\" in some hours and \"dec\" in others -- with no consistent patterns.The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power:  PX Block Forward, PX Day Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post.  They had ample opportunity to purchase lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough.  That left them short in the Day Ahead.  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some of their load to the Ex Post market.  Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.The ISO remains primarily in \"inc\" mode even during the shoulder months when prices are lower, another indicator that the real time \"inc\" problem is driven by the load side rather than the supply side.  The IOU's continue to go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market.  Does it matter that the price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?The NOx market in California is very tight.  How has this contributed to higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any generators from running?How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side?  The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest.  (I have a theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the west from an economic perspective.  I can go into more detail if you wish.)Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets.  For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of the state are higher?  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 8/11 and 8/12.  There was congestion from California TO the northwest those days in the Day Ahead market.  In real time the NW ended up being a net seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is \"workably competitive\" then there is no need for price caps.  Is large-scale economic demand response required for a competitive market?  What if demand response is there, but at very high prices?  The demand response in California is a joke.  With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only get around 600 MW of economic demand response.  Much of this response comes at $1500/MWh.  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic grounds.  So why this assymetric treatment?  This gets to the question of the fine line between \"scarcity rents\" which are ok, and market power which is not.  If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then shouldn't that be the price.  At what price would the rest of the interuptible load economically curtail?  Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not to or values power at more than $1500/MWh.Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market power?  The reports published to date have been unimpressive.  The Market Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then concludes that there is market power.  But they never explain why.  I would think that proof might be something like this:  Generator X sets price y% of the time when loads exceed Z MWs.  Or, four generators set price 80% of the time when prices exceed $200/MWh.  They have all the data to be able to tell, yet they don't provide any empirical measures.  The only test I've heard of so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators are submitting bids above their marginal cost.  The PX report states that supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year.  They fail to mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to last.\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

MITI and the Government are currently examining why the initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and looking to move the 2003 review forward to next year. There are currently two multi party committees looking at the energy sector. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy. In addition, MITI is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to consider the next stage of deregulation. \n","As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved.

We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist in the deregulation process in a positive way.\n","What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be structured in the future.\n","Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will receive a cabinet position if Gov. Bush is elected. As a result, Mr Lay currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in Japan. In the period prior to the Presidential election, we have an ideal opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese Government through Mr Lay.\n","A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government members would significantly increase Enron's profile in Japan and assist in conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation.\n","If Mr Lay were to visit Japan, possibly in late October or early November, we would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and arrange a number of high level commercial meetings.

Heat wave is  expected to continue today.   NANCY RIVERA BROOKS \n","  09/19/2000   Los Angeles Times   Home Edition   Page C-1   Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company \n","  Sweltering weather across California pushed the state's heat-stressed electricity grid close  to meltdown Monday, and state power officials urged electricity conservation because today  and Wednesday could be even worse.\n","  Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about 125,000 residential and  business air-conditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after the California  Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid for about 75% of the state,  declared a Stage 2 power emergency. At Stage 2, when the grid is using more than 95% of  available power, the state's big investor-owned utilities are asked to interrupt power to  customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for discounted rates.\n","  Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern California stopped  working for a time as heavy air-conditioner demand began to push power use higher,  Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said.\n","  Demand peaked at about 42,000 megawatts on the Cal-ISO grid, but the two unidentified  units, representing about 320 megawatts of generation, were returned to service in the  afternoon--in time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage 3, which would lead to  neighborhood blackouts.\n","  \"We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage 3,\" McCorkle said. \"A couple  of generators fell offline in late morning, and that kind of gave everybody a scare.\"\n","  A Stage 3 emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below 1.5%--in essence,  when the electricity grid is using more than 98.5% of available power--and rotating outages  of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep the grid from  failing. That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hours.\n","  Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles Department of Water  and Power, peaking near 4,750 megawatts Monday. But DWP customers were not  threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the municipal utility has  more than enough generating capacity to meet demand.\n","  \"We're doing OK as we have all summer long,\" said DWP General Manager S. David  Freeman.\n","  Cal-ISO asked Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas &  Electric to call on all of their interruptible-power customers to immediately stop using  electricity, representing a potential 3,000 megawatts, or roughly the amount of electricity  used by 3 million homes.\n","  Thousands of students at College of the Canyons in Valencia experienced the California  equivalent of a snow day Monday when power outage alarms rang about 1:30 p.m, the  seventh time this year, college spokesman Sue Bozman said. If the college doesn't pull the  plug, it pays a big fine.\n","  \"For several years, we saved $100,000 a year by being on this interruptible-service plan,\"  said Bozman, who with other administrators finished the work day with mobile phones and  portable computers. \"But when the alarm rings and we decline to turn off our power, it's a  whole different ballgame.\"\n","  One such day in May, during final exams, the college didn't cut power and penalties totaled  $30,000, she said.\n","  During the height of Monday's power crisis, PG&E--whose territory suffered local blackouts  on June 14 in a similar reliability emergency--kept an open telephone line to Cal-ISO for  minute-by-minute updates, spokesman Ron Low said.\n","  SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity as possible, and  grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other power use to comply.\n","  \"We're issuing a call to action, a call that everyone needs to take seriously,\" Pam Bass,  SCE's senior vice president for customer service, said in a statement as electricity use  soared Monday. \"If the demand for power does not decrease soon, we will be directed by  the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers. Everyone needs to cut their  use of power now to avoid forced outages.\"\n","  Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging: Cal-ISO is predicting peak use of  44,827 megawatts for today. Peak demand was expected to be 44,537 megawatts on  Monday, but conservation and power-interruption programs kept the total lower.\n","  \"We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today,\" SCE spokeswoman Karen  Shepard-Grimes said Monday. Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at 17,860  megawatts before the Rosemead-based utility asked power customers to cut 2,500  megawatts of electricity. \"It got really touchy today,\" she said.\n","  *\n","  Times staff writer Zanto Peabody contributed to this report. \n","  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.

In addition, LDC purchased gas cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions (e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases.

The oil belonged to Tosco.  We had/have a contract to haul this oil for Tosco and were performing through Cummings.  We outsourced our crude oil hauling function in California to Cummings and other companies last year, and many of our former crude drivers went to work for Cummings and these companies.  The oil has gone into navigable waters and has reached the Pacific Ocean (during spawning season).  This incident is on the front page of today's L.A. Times Metro Section. ACCORDING TO ED ATTANASIO,  NEITHER EOTT NOR ENRON IS MENTIONED IN THE TIMES COVERAGE.  It is quite possible that Tosco will seek indemnity from us (in connection with this incident) under the terms of our hauling contract with them.   The liabilities here for Tosco could be very significant.  Ed Attanasio is monitoring this situation closely.  \n","  We need to be sensitive to this situation for a number of reasons.  Someone may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter.  Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard.  At this juncture, we need to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter.  Until further notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty Cunningham .  Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver.  We should otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further comment at this time.  Also, Lori and Molly,  we will need to decide very soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate time, we should see what Baird thinks.  We will look to Cummings and their insurance carriers  to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don't have enough information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may have in this matter.  Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and advise on this ASAP.

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate action on energy legislation, and a likely confrontation over whether to allow oil drilling in an Arctic wildlife refuge, is being put off until early next year. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Tuesday he is committed to bringing an energy bill up for floor debate within the first weeks after Congress returns in January. Daschle has said that other pressing matters such as economic recovery, national security in light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and remaining government spending bills, leave no time to deal with energy this year. It is ``not only my expectation, but my commitment that we will take the bill up during that first work period'' next year, meaning before the Senate's recess for Presidents' Day in mid-February. Congress is expected to recess in mid-December and return in January. Senate Republicans have accused Daschle of blocking consideration of energy legislation to avoid a heated debate over development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. A number of Democrats have vowed to filibuster any attempt to open the refuge to oil companies, which has been a key element of President Bush's domestic energy development strategy. ``It's a great concern to me and a number of senators that we are not going to be able to consider energy policy for our country before the end of the year, especially in view of the fact that we see now continuing uncertainty about what is going to be done by OPEC countries,'' said GOP leader Trent Lott of Mississippi. Republicans have argued that legislation is needed to spur domestic energy development and ease U.S. reliance on oil imports including those from the Persian Gulf. Democrats have maintained that most of the provisions in an energy bill will be aimed at long-term measures and should not be rushed through in the final weeks of the session. Amid talk of an energy crisis, the House last summer passed a fairly broad energy bill. But its plans to follow with a series of measures aimed specifically at the electricity industry, a key part of a comprehensive energy blueprint, were sidetracked by the events of Sept. 11. Since then, energy prices across the board from oil and natural gas to gasoline and electric power have declined dramatically with plenty of supplies, easing the crisis atmosphere that prevailed less than a year ago. \n","Carin NersesianLegislative CoordinatorEnron Corp.202-466-9144 (ph.)202-828-3372 (fax)\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 1.0 .

The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now.  We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,  and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.  We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together.  Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.  This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance.  We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress.  A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me).

We then met up with GM on the Friday.\n","Basically GM Petroleos (the main GM company) has entered into the Spanish equivalent of U.S. Ch.11. We have still not seen a copy of the petition presented to the Court, but this shd be forthcoming in the next day or so. The idea behind the petition for suspension of payments is to help companies that are facing liquidity problems. GM wd certainly fit that bill, although it remains doubtful as to whether GM can claim that its assets exceed its liabilities. The effect of the petition is to provide a moratorium on the repayment of any unsecured creditors, and on any judgments which those creditors obtain. The petition does not however prevent any preferred or secured creditors from enforcing their debts (in the latter case, to the extent of their security). \n","The judge to whom the petition is presented appoints 3 administrators. 2 are appointed from a list of accountants that the court maintains, and the third (also appointed by the court) is a representative of one of the top third of the list of creditors.\n","Once the administrators are appointed, the financial control of GMP will be their responsibility. They will authorize any future transactions, draw up the definitive list of creditors, and examine the solvency or otherwise of the company. In due course they will submit a report to the judge advising as to whether the company is insolvent or not. If insolvent, the Court will request that GMP provide a warranty for the difference between the amount owed and the assets. If this is not met within 14 days, subsidiary proceedings may be started to examine any personal liability of the management. \n","Parallel with this, the administrators will be speaking to all the creditors with a view to reaching an inter creditor arrangement on repayment of an agreed level of debt. Even though secured creditors are not precluded in enforcing their security during the suspension of payments procedure, it is usual for them too to take part in these discussions.\n","The outside lawyers seemed to think that the amount contained in the petition is equivalent to USD 85 million. We have no real idea how this is broken down, but the following shd be a rough guide:\n","VAT authority - USD 25 millionVeba - USD 15 millionEnron - USD 5 millionTotal - USD 3millionBank debt - USD 22 million - balance USD15 million\n","The Spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure may be difficult to prove as a debt. This exposure arises from the market difference we agreed to sell Dec. shipments to GMP (which then cd not put up the agreed purchase price to ensure delivery) and the current market price. Chris can confirm what these losses are today. We wd have to sue on those agreements (English arbitration), and then present to the administrators the arbitration judgments. However, as the administrators report is usually ready within 2-3months, I suspect that leaving aside any other factors there may be a timing problem here. \n","The Spanish lawyers said that GMP Board may have some personal liability issues. The Board is supposed to call a shareholders meeting if the company is in financial difficulties. Moreover, if there has been stripping out of assets from GMP, then those responsible may face criminal sanction\n","On the issue of preferences, it wd appear that Spanish law is somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand there is old jurisprudence to the effect that any and all transactions entered into by the debtor before its insolvency can be challenged by the administrators, irrespective of whether those transactions wd constitute a preference. On the other hand there is jurisprudence of equivalent weight which states that this is not the case, and that only preferences may be challenged. The Spanish lawyers were not able to say which system wd apply in the current scenario, but their insolvency lawyer made the following points:\n","there was no immediate threat from anyone against Enron or ECTRIC Spain. The whole issue about preferences is not dealt with until the report by the administrators is made to the judge. There is no chance of any nasty shocks like injunctions on Arcos etc.the payment to Enron of USD50 million at the same time as the VAT authorities were not being paid shd not overly worry Enron at the moment, as such payments are unlikely to be seen as a preference.most companies (even those judged insolvent) end up being dissolved voluntarily, probably as a result of the uncertainty of Spanish insolvency law. If a voluntary arrangement is reached it is unlikely to provide for anything but the most obvious preference (and the transfer of the strategic oil from GM to ECTRIC Spain wd not fall within this category)The VAT authorities (probably the main creditor) are not pro active in these sorts of proceedings and tend to take a back seat   \n","For what t is worth, GM made the following points:\n","GM's banks' inability to fund further prompted GMP management to make the petition (this despite the fact that GM had previously assured Enron that the GMP bank debt was minimal)petition is for Pta 10 billionGM lawyer said shd have made decision earlier to present the petitionGM lawyer also said that GMP had made what he called \"third party financing\" of Pta 6 billion, and accepted my suggestion that the administrators wd be asking for such funds back GMP wd be willing to put up Don Antonio's assets to secure Enron's continuing supplies to it (we have heard that many times before). Without such supplies GM stated that GMP was insolvent. They were not able to provide a reason as to why such assets cd not be pledged beforehandGMP sees Enron as the \"key\", namely that the supplies if resumed wd trigger the payment to GM of its outstanding receivables.  GM wants Enron to meet with the administrators next week.\n","It is early days but I wd suggest the following:\n","unlikely the old man's assets will be forthcominglikley the company will go into insolvencylikley the creditors will reach a voluntary arrangementtherefore unlikely there will be any clawback of earlier payments/strategic storage oilequally, unlikely Enron will receive any recognition of its MTM debt \n","Chris, let me know if there is anything you wd like to add/clarify. otherwise once we get the petition we will advise further. tks\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 1.0 .

Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise.  The call to Barton was to:  a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit for the defeat of price caps.  I hear from lots of DC sources that we have not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Numerous folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's first real role in the Committee.  Thus, even though this is a very limited bill, the call made sense.

Below is a short excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning Enron:\n","\"Proponents of renewable power viewed California's deregulation as flawed from the onset three years ago. Still, they anticipated that with adequate publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the traditional power supply, which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil fuels and nuclear power, and that the demand would spur supply. The number of producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow -- as long as the big utilities didn't interfere.\n","That's what almost happened. Over the last three years, retailers like Green Mountain Energy and Utility.com bought green power already available in California and started to invest in building their own renewable energy generators, like windmill farms and large solar-panel assemblies. Still, for all the optimism and effort, only about 200,000 customers -- less than 1 percent of the 8.5 million households that had the option of switching providers -- chose to support them. Many of those were swayed by a deregulation-mandated credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who switched. When natural gas prices were high, the credit actually represented a real savings. Historically, environmentally conscious consumers have paid a penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, along with an average monthly surcharge of $5.\n","Then, last fall, the fledgling industry started to crumble. Energy wholesalers like Enron (NYSE: ENE) and Calpine (NYSE: CPN) responded to a rising demand for energy by raising their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt hour to as much as $1.50. Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy power. Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a price that was less than their cost. When the energy crisis hit, many green consumers' bills more than doubled.\"\n","In light of the recent e-mail that was sent out, I thought that I would bring this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that Enron does not raise prices, it transacts in a market where prices are set by supply and demand.  The average person reading this could very easily come to the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy companies, which is clearly not the case.  Nonetheless, thought you might find this of interest.\n","Chris HilgertEnron AmericasEnron Compression Services\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

The state is expected to face such shortages routinely this summer, and the order has the potential to shave billions of dollars off California's electricity bill if implemented fully, some people at the federal agency say.\n","\"The president has a long-held belief that price caps don't work,\" the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said today. \"The last thing you want to do is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm the availability of supply.\"\n","Mr. Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal agency, adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand its orders.\n","But Mr. Bush did appoint the commission's chairman, Curtis L. H,bert Jr., a Republican. Like the president, Mr. H,bert has often insisted that price caps do no good. But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the agency's largely hands- off approach to the California crisis. Some of that pressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency, both Democrats, and Mr. H,bert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night.\n","The split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether the president will seek to replace Mr. H,bert as chairman in coming weeks. Mr. Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the commission, including Pat Wood, a longtime ally of the president who served as chief electricity regulator in Texas. Industry executives say they expect that Mr. Bush will eventually name Mr. Wood to the commission's top post.\n","In a reflection of how delicate the issue is, Mr. H,bert argued that the agency's action did not amount to imposing price caps. But his position appeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost- based electricity regulation (as some Californians favor) and the agency's decision to impose tactical price controls.\n","Among California officials, the dominant reaction was disappointment. Some state regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing upside-down economics: it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of severe scarcity, when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage companies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity.\n","The agency, its critics argue, has chosen to ignore price abuses during times of relative abundance, when power generators, the critics say, have used artificial market power to earn high profits.\n","\"They got it exactly wrong,\" said Frank Wolak, chief market supervisor for the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid. \"It looks like they're doing something, but it doesn't work in real time.\"\n","Mr. Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year * in amounts that he puts in the billions of dollars * occurred when electricity supplies were not acutely short, meaning that the agency's price caps would have had no mitigating effect.\n","The state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer. But, Mr. Wolak said, generating companies have become adept at \"gaming\" the system. He predicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in California.\n","One fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to affiliates out of state. When California's transmission grid managers scramble to find supplies, the same companies will offer to sell the power back to the state, but only above the cap price. The agency's new order includes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse, known as megawatt laundering. But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such mandates, and California officials are skeptical.\n","The order also came under fire on other grounds. The commission said that price caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link its transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region, a priority of the agency that state officials have resisted.\n","Linda Stuntz, an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the agency, called that clause bizarre, arguing that it held the entire California market hostage to a technical filing requirement.\n","California politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were carried out as promised, relief would be too limited.\n","The price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of the least efficient generating plant in the state. The order as written means that companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell power at large mark-ups during periods when caps are imposed. When the agency scrutinized the California market earlier this year, it found the high-cost generators to be justified in charging about $300 a megawatt hour for electricity, a price that is about 10 times as high as the state was paying for power a year ago.\n","Copyright 2001 The New York Times Company\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

No candidates should be referred to the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and resolved  ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the candidate.Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary.John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out of town, these will be conducted via telephone.\n","Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial StaffEffective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows:For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason or justification for offering them a contract.In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction.Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft financial terms on the familiar contract request form.Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail.Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a fresh draft will be produced.\n","The following HR Representatives will assist you with these new procedures:\n","Power Trading  - Kim Melodick  57273Gas Trading  - Jeanie Slone  53847West Power  - Amy Fitzpatrick  PortlandWest Orgin  - Amy Fitzpatrick  PortlandEast Orgin  - Fran Mayes  37211M&A, Principle Inv - Dave Hill  34218Upstream Orig  - Dave Hill  34218  Capital Services - Dave Hill  34218 Generation Assets - Dave Hill  34218Mexico   - Dave Hill  34218 East Coast Power - Dave Hill  34218Canada (Trading/Orig) - Dawn Doucet  CalgaryEnergy Op's  - Sheila Walton  30649BAR   - Sheila Walton  30649Legal   - Sheila Walton  30649Comp Analysis  - Sheila Walton  30649Research  - Sheila Walton  30649\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 1.0 .

I am currently a Development Support Manager with EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I  had the good fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.  He represents a company called IdleAire Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also, these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.\n","IdleAire's  goal is to: \n","\"........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television.\"\n","Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, D.C.  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.  \n","I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do.  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and the capital to invest in this project.  \n","Enron would benefit in several ways:\n","1.  Greater than average returns.\n","2.  Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.  (EPA Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....)\n","3.  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.\n","4.  Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.\n","5.  Open a whole new market for the energy services group. (EES)  Long term maintenance contract, commodities, etc....\n","6.  Open a new market for the broadband services group. (EBS)  Videos on demand.\n","I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.  If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce him to you.  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an executive summary of the business.

The letter is attached way at the bottom of this e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies.  I have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it was delivered.\n","I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the strategies we are developing.  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air \"messages\" that we can use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with the Administration, revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses, responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A, and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work.\n","The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most part.  I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like:  \"Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?\"   In my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions.  Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken.\n","For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile in London) -- \"Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results.\"  I believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its shareholder initiatives, etc.    Also, this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to, like:  What about Kyoto is not workable?  What would make it workable and would we help make it workable?  If not Kyoto, what is Enron's preferred \"vehicle?\"  I'd really rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid reference to Kyoto altogether.\n","I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace.

The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now.  We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,  and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.  We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together.  Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.  This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance.  We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress.  A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me).  I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask.

In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have   taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies   and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the   loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less   (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be   sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in   Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is   non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have   discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to   potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.   The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken   by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private   parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which   although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on   the company's liquidity position.\n","   Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in   Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken   or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an   effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor   confidence?

(EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were a rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston.  Attached is a memo we handed out to employees, but basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.   3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process.   a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer.\n","I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.

I serve as Chairman of the VMA's EnergyResources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and theday-long agenda it will entail.\n","As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or anotherkey individual, the VMA  is offering Enron an opportunity to participate inits seminar in an important way.  We seek to have Enron speak on thesubject of the developing competitive market and how that market may beaccessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many,if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia.  The purpose ofthe seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able,under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passedin 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1,2002, and by no later than January 1, 2003.  The subject is becoming a highpriority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues todaygenerally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available toVirginia customers.\n","We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members whotoday hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminarparticipant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives inCalifornia and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospectsfor successful competition and effective choice in Virginia.  Enron couldhopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers oncethe day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform,aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrellaorganization, is considering), and related topics.\n","The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possibleEnron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:00pm.  Weexpect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offerattendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislatorsand others who have been closely involved  with the development of theVirginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years orso.\n","I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and againthank you for your assistance.

The $220 billion industry, which has been called the last great government-sanctioned monopoly, is slowly but surely being deregulated and opened to competition, giving consumers the power to choose their electricity provider in much the same way they choose telephone carriers.Deregulation, now scheduled to occur on January 1, 2002, is coming to Texas and with it comes the power of choice for most Texans. Just like you can choose your phone or cable provider, you will soon be able to choose your electric provider.

Drew has strong networking skills, which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills.  The second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years.  John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent.  John left the Committee in 1992.  Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills.  John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years.

We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday.\n","John\n","To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company\n","Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),  Coal,  LNG & Weather.   We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities.  However, while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?]  Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market.  \n","We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market.  [deleted text] Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year.\n","The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.\n","Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London.\n","By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a part of Enron Europe.\n","EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  by year end.\n","The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months.\n","In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. \n","Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shapiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets.\n","We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.\n","End Message.\n","\n","CONTROL: Prediction: 0.0 .

The council includes several prominent permanent members drawn from the  business and academic communities, to which we add distinguished guests with expertise in areas of interest to us on an ad hoc basis. Several of our top executives attend these meetings.    I am hoping that you might help us in two ways. Irwin tells me that your headquarters building is innovative and has many features that it would be well worth our while to know about and to study. Would it be possible for you to arrange a tour for a few of our executives, both from the US and the UK, say on the morning of October 30?    Second, we understand from Irwin and from the press that you have done wonders in reinvigorating and revitalizing the BA staff. I am hoping that you might be willing to share some of the secrets of your success with us, perhaps at an informal buffet lunch at our new London headquarters on October 31, or at some other time on that day that might be more convenient for you.
