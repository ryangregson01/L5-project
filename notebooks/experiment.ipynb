Subject: Moving foward at a good clip Steve Good news. As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week. We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey's leadership. She explored my views about doing business with government. Shortly thereafter, Dave's office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26. Kay Chapman explained that Dave's schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16. In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday. (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.) Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet? Thank you for your all of your help.

The EPSA staff draft of a letter to Barton on his RTO discussion proposal will be significantly strengthened and EPSA staff will start by incorporating the comments I sent over earlier in the week.

My reply was this \"logic\" was like saying we should be grateful he shot us in the head instead of hanging us -- one method may be more \"humane\" but either way we are \"dead\" (OK, the analogy may be too rough -- but it made the point.) (I subsequently confirmed that Reliant is the \"soft\" member -- their rep. told me they \"support the discussion draft although they wouldn\\'t object if it is strengthened.\") A stronger EPSA letter with more specific reasons why we oppose the Barton discussion draft will be circulated among EPSA members today or Monday, with the goal of sending the letter first thing Tuesday when Congress returns. Some wanted a general letter requesting a meeting, and deferring specific comments until the meeting. I pointed out that Barton is speaking to subcommittee members right now and that we needed to copy them on a more detailed letter ASAP so they hear from us before Barton gets to them. We will make the same contacts ourselves. In fact, we have already started. Spoke to Reps. Chip Pickering and Rep. Greg Walden, both subcommittee Republicans, this week (did same with staff to Rep.

In view of these factors, V&E should tell us whether we can use the $2.5 million of cash from the insurance recovery to retroactively reclaim a portion of the 4th quarter API's. In particular, Baird should give us this opinion since he has handled the partnership agreement since day one. Baird is gone on vacation for the next week. He is planning to give us an answer within a few days of his return. He will give the matter serious thought, but what we are asking is pretty aggressive. His associate, Carlos Pena, has reviewed the partnership agreement and his first take on the question is that we cannot revise the available cash for the fourth quarter in this way. But the matter requires far more thought than this----and Bob will also need to talk with Lori (also gone on vacation) to come up with a meaningful answer for us. I will stay after this, but in light of the above, it will probably be early July b/f we get V&E's final position on this.

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE service. The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now. We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU, and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues. We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together. Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar. This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance. We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress. A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me). I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask. If timing is bad for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative.

I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency.

The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs. Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable energy projects. During consideration of the bill, several amendments of interest and concern to Enron were offered and withdrawn; they are likely to be offered when the full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday and Wednesday. The amendments in this category are: 1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the \"blackout and price gouging prevention amendment\" that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be withholding power from the grid during an emergency. The cost-of-service rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity\\'s sales in the Western U.S. Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it until full committee. We will continue those efforts before the full committee vote. 2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill rather than full committee on this bill). 3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places. He said that currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC approved. 4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a UN agreement that President George Bush (\"41\") agreed to in 1992 (reducing these emissions to 1990 levels).

We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at this stage) you need to know the following. The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session. As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight. Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request. Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services. She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you. We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward. We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people. This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner. Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting. The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future. I had planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us. Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point. These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.

My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected. It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \"fault\" for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points. Whoever is blamed might not really matter. My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West. This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets. Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets. Commissioner Massey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done. FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity and intrastate take away capacity (which, by the way, doesn\\'t appear to address storage). Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport costs.

Gas prices were controversial. Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it was less than a dollar in other areas. He then noted that the high gas cost would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must act regarding the high transport differentials- \"We will never get a handle on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices\". That opened the floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner Breathitt of FERC\\'s technical conference (notice of which issued today) on the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy of infrastructure within CA. She said that this would shed light on basis differentials and gas prices. Freudian slip? Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall below 7%). Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen. Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., Stages 1, 2 or 3): Hebert opined \"Most of the time\". Breathitt said \"Likely 80-85% of the time\". Massey was unconvinced. Several Senators railed at the Commission for \"not doing its job\" and threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act.

Ray ---------------------.\\nResponse: [ANSWER]sensitive[/ANSWER]', '175305_2': 'Now classify:\\nText: Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western Electric Situation I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today. House hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality). Senate hearing was on last week\\'s FERC order on a \"soft price cap\" and related issues. The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation Implementation Task Force. In addition, there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA. The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners. HIghlights Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week. There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants. The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region to support sec. 102. Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could be done; the witnesses just said \"cost plus a reasonable profit\" and said leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last week\\'s soft price cap is much better. Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR) got the Cal Energy Comm chair to admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken recently. The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \"help is on the way\" in the form of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat contentious at times.

Bush meeting with high-tech council JIM VERTUNO, Wednesday July 19, 8:53 am Associated Press Writer AUSTIN, Texas (AP)???Gov. George W. Bush wants to compare notes on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to closing the so-called ``digital divide'' that sometimes leaves minority households behind in the computer age during a planned Wednesday meeting with technology leaders. About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member high-tech council, including Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were scheduled to meet behind closed doors at Austin's Jewish Community Center.?. . ``I am excited about all of the opportunities that technology has given us to make a profound and positive impact on the world,'' said Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. ``America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is vital for us to maintain this status,'' Bush said. '' Leading the world in innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create many quality jobs.'' The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to present Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew.

Rosie ---------------------.\\nResponse: [ANSWER]sensitive[/ANSWER]', '173245_2': 'Now classify:\\nText: Subject: Office of the Chairman: While traveling within Germany recently, I noticed that electric powered trains are popular and also provide a safe, reliable, affordable and comfortable means of transportation to the public. This brought to mind a question to ask you: Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business Development Offices? I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available.

Twice in the last three months I have run into the Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by Stan Horton who had decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when AGA \"kicked\" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of sub membership for around 85K. AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got back to them as promised. This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron\\'s oldest customers and friends will be calling Lay. It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza. In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year. Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM. In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM\\'s problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA\\'s with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on the company\\'s liquidity position. Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The same could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall \"guidance\" question. Let\\'s take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that\\'s ok with you.

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants). Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing. Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day. Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices. Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic. It\\'s attached. Apologies, it\\'s quick and dirty, but it provides the basics. Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling. Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Questions the report raises for Enron: Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance sector? Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks to IT systems. The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year. Discussions with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value. If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as $13K per year. An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the LLC\\'s governance body to ensure Enron\\'s needs were addressed. Archie Dunham, CONOCO\\'s Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council recommends it at the 6 June meeting. Current coordination: The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO. Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative. Recent DOJ action regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that anti-trust will not be an issue. Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them. Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT protection efforts in next two weeks. Recommendation: Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector\\'s efforts - As Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a \"one-stop-shop\" format is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve Largent and Chip Pickering. After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next week. Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine whether to proceed further. There is a general perception that committee leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported legislation. In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines. As the drafts progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case. A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal siting. However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant interest groups not willing to go along. Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO. There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the minimalist package. There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market rates. Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others. As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up occurs. In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday. That package will have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and reformulated gasoline.

The oil belonged to Tosco. We had/have a contract to haul this oil for Tosco and were performing through Cummings. We outsourced our crude oil hauling function in California to Cummings and other companies last year, and many of our former crude drivers went to work for Cummings and these companies. The oil has gone into navigable waters and has reached the Pacific Ocean (during spawning season). This incident is on the front page of today's L.A. Times Metro Section. ACCORDING TO ED ATTANASIO, NEITHER EOTT NOR ENRON IS MENTIONED IN THE TIMES COVERAGE. It is quite possible that Tosco will seek indemnity from us (in connection with this incident) under the terms of our hauling contract with them. The liabilities here for Tosco could be very significant. Ed Attanasio is monitoring this situation closely. We need to be sensitive to this situation for a number of reasons. Someone may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter. Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard. At this juncture, we need to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter. Until further notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty Cunningham . Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver. We should otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further comment at this time. Also, Lori and Molly, we will need to decide very soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate time, we should see what Baird thinks. We will look to Cummings and their insurance carriers to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don't have enough information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may have in this matter. Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and advise on this ASAP.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing. I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc). I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids. This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated. Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Vince .\\nResponse: [ANSWER]sensitive[/ANSWER]', '52170_2': \"Now classify:\\nText: Subject: Vince, I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

I cannot give you a personal recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a trade secret or as a patented commodity. I ultimately struck a compromise position by filing my own \"provisional patent application.\" This establishes the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent? or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys. Of these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for your son\\'s software idea. He talked as though he had a particular specialty in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive. He practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408) 282-1856. I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office. Basic information and forms can be downloaded from there. Two other, newer sites might also intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of intellectual property, patents, etc. They are: pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) yet2come.com Hope this is helpful.

We\\'re also looking to increase your exposure with employees. We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a couple of weeks ago. It\\'s called \"Jeff\\'s Corner\" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 99.9% of our employees. This is how it will work. We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking about what\\'s top of mind at that moment. The tone and style will be like your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and conversational. We suggest the first topic be \"The State of Enron.\" There is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we\\'ve taken as a company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about the widespread re-deployment efforts. These recent events are beginning to affect morale. Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we\\'re on the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year. You\\'ve helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force. Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost. We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly. The nice thing about this medium is we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you speak to employees gives the message credibility. Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc. We\\'d like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you\\'d like to discuss. I\\'ve checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this now. I will check your calendar with Sherri. Let me know if you have any questions.

As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week. We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey\\'s leadership. She explored my views about doing business with government. Shortly thereafter, Dave\\'s office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26. Kay Chapman explained that Dave\\'s schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16. In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday. (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.) Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday\\'s meeting with Janet? Thank you for your all of your help. I am pleased and appreciative that things are moving forward at a good clip.

The EPSA staff draft of a letter to Barton on his RTO discussion proposal will be significantly strengthened and EPSA staff will start by incorporating the comments I sent over earlier in the week. The original draft said the Barton RTO language only needed \"technical corrections.\" EPSA staff reiterated that some member co. or cos. think Barton\\'s draft could have been worse. My reply was this \"logic\" was like saying we should be grateful he shot us in the head instead of hanging us -- one method may be more \"humane\" but either way we are \"dead\" (OK, the analogy may be too rough -- but it made the point.) (I subsequently confirmed that Reliant is the \"soft\" member -- their rep. told me they \"support the discussion draft although they wouldn\\'t object if it is strengthened.\") A stronger EPSA letter with more specific reasons why we oppose the Barton discussion draft will be circulated among EPSA members today or Monday, with the goal of sending the letter first thing Tuesday when Congress returns. Some wanted a general letter requesting a meeting, and deferring specific comments until the meeting. I pointed out that Barton is speaking to subcommittee members right now and that we needed to copy them on a more detailed letter ASAP so they hear from us before Barton gets to them. We will make the same contacts ourselves. In fact, we have already started. Spoke to Reps. Chip Pickering and Rep. Greg Walden, both subcommittee Republicans, this week (did same with staff to Rep. John Shimkus). Key task when House staff return to work on Tuesday will be finding out where Ranking Member Rick Boucher is on the Barton RTO draft.

While the day to day control will remain where it is and all the efforts assign contracts and other work should progress as planned, since the value to Enron Corp. is the power marketing certificate nothing should be done to jeopardize this.

It is complicated and has been amended several times. In view of these factors, V&E should tell us whether we can use the $2.5 million of cash from the insurance recovery to retroactively reclaim a portion of the 4th quarter API\\'s. In particular, Baird should give us this opinion since he has handled the partnership agreement since day one. Baird is gone on vacation for the next week. He is planning to give us an answer within a few days of his return. He will give the matter serious thought, but what we are asking is pretty aggressive. His associate, Carlos Pena, has reviewed the partnership agreement and his first take on the question is that we cannot revise the available cash for the fourth quarter in this way. But the matter requires far more thought than this----and Bob will also need to talk with Lori (also gone on vacation) to come up with a meaningful answer for us. I will stay after this, but in light of the above, it will probably be early July b/f we get V&E\\'s final position on this. If this won\\'t do, please let me know and I\\'ll explore other avenues of getting an answer out of V&E. Thanks.

As you know, her firm represents the Government of India. She initiated the conversation on India and our issues there, saying something to the effect that the firm has told the Indian government how important Enron is and how close Ken is to the White House. They also told the Embassy that the issue would NOT likely come up in the Bush meeting with the PM since the Finance Minister will be in town for World Bank meetings and they assumed it would come up at that level. I said I was not handling the issue. She said the firm would be open to trying to work out the issue or help with same in bringing the two sides together. Also reminded me that Sen. Dole is at the firm. All I said on substance was that certainly India understood the importance of this issue on the foreign investment climate there. FYI.

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE service. The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now. We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU, and solicit Charlie\\'s support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues. We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives\\' offices will help bring the parties together. Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar. This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance. We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress. A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me). I am not sure that Ken\\'s schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask. If timing is bad for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative. I will follow up with a phone call to you. Hope this helps. [/TEXT].\\n[ANSWER]\\nThe attribute that classifies the Text as \"sensitive\" is \"personal information\".

Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free market, in my view. I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.) I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency. I am often at odds with \"the industry view\" regarding CFTC issues. I don\\'t think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it\\'s been such a backwater. I am looking for some good folks. Have at least one person who would be good at that job. And it\\'s not Newsome. Please do not share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I\\'m too free market and have argued against their \"fixes\"). Sorry for this scathing review, but this is an important appointment. Wendy[/TEXT].\\n[ANSWER]\\nThe attribute that classifies the Text as \"sensitive\" is \"personal information\".

The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs. Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable energy projects. During consideration of the bill, several amendments of interest and concern to Enron were offered and withdrawn; they are likely to be offered when the full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday and Wednesday. The amendments in this category are: 1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the \"blackout and price gouging prevention amendment\" that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be withholding power from the grid during an emergency. The cost-of-service rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity\\'s sales in the Western U.S. Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it until full committee. We will continue those efforts before the full committee vote. 2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill rather than full committee on this bill). 3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places. He said that currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC approved. 4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a UN agreement that President George Bush (\"41\") agreed to in 1992 (reducing these emissions to 1990 levels). Chairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric restructuring bill either later this month or early in September, depending on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full committee and in the full House.[/TEXT].\\n[ANSWER]\\nThe attribute that classifies the Text as \"sensitive\" is \"Enron\".

We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually (I\\'m not quite certain that is possible at this stage) you need to know the following. The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session. As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan\\'s industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We\\'ll hear more tonight. Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request. Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services. She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you. We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward. We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people. This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner. Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick\\'s memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe\\'s energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting. The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future. I had planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us. Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point. These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision. Joe [/TEXT].\\n[ANSWER]\\nThe attribute that classifies the Text as \"sensitive\" is \"commercial information\".

I\\'m not sure we can convince Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example, but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines: gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state. gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity. gas utilities fialed to fill storage. gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal border I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets. In short, if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in California, not outside. Ray Alvarez 05/04/2001 09:02 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western Electric Situation Steve, I\\'ve been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices lately and decided to pass this info along because I think it\\'s a red flag. My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected. It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \"fault\" for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points. Whoever is blamed might not really matter. My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West. This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets. Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets. Commissioner Massey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done. FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity and intrastate take away capacity (which, by the way, doesn\\'t appear to address storage). Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport costs.

Gas prices were controversial. Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it was less than a dollar in other areas. He then noted that the high gas cost would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must act regarding the high transport differentials- \"We will never get a handle on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices\". That opened the floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner Breathitt of FERC\\'s technical conference (notice of which issued today) on the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy of infrastructure within CA. She said that this would shed light on basis differentials and gas prices. Freudian slip? Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall below 7%). Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen. Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., Stages 1, 2 or 3): Hebert opined \"Most of the time\". Breathitt said \"Likely 80-85% of the time\". Massey was unconvinced. Several Senators railed at the Commission for \"not doing its job\" and threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act. If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free to call.

House hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality). Senate hearing was on last week\\'s FERC order on a \"soft price cap\" and related issues. The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation Implementation Task Force. In addition, there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA. The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners. HIghlights Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week. There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants. The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region to support sec. 102. Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could be done; the witnesses just said \"cost plus a reasonable profit\" and said leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last week\\'s soft price cap is much better. Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR) got the Cal Energy Comm chair to admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken recently. The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \"help is on the way\" in the form of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat contentious at times. Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.

It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton. They requested the report be updated. A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page. I read the summary and will read the balance. So far, so good. It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged. However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers. The report\\'s major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets. The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying \"And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.\"[/TEXT].\\n[ANSWER]\\nThe attribute that classifies the Text as \"sensitive\" is \"governing policies and juris', '175849_0': '[ANSWER], include only the attribute, and finish with [/ANSWER].[/INST]\\n[TEXT]----[/TEXT].\\n[ANSWER]\\nThe attribute \"sensitive\" classifies the Text.', '176656': '[ANSWER], include only the attribute, and finish with [/ANSWER].[/INST]\\n[TEXT]Subject: Re: Sorry I missed this on Friday -- was on vacation end of last week and rest of this week.

Bush meeting with high-tech council JIM VERTUNO, Wednesday July 19, 8:53 am Associated Press Writer AUSTIN, Texas (AP)???Gov. George W. Bush wants to compare notes on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to closing the so-called ``digital divide\\'\\' that sometimes leaves minority households behind in the computer age during a planned Wednesday meeting with technology leaders. About 130 members of the Bush campaign\\'s 350-member high-tech council, including Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were scheduled to meet behind closed doors at Austin\\'s Jewish Community Center.?. . ``I am excited about all of the opportunities that technology has given us to make a profound and positive impact on the world,\\'\\' said Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. ``America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is vital for us to maintain this status,\\'\\' Bush said. \\'\\' Leading the world in innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create many quality jobs.\\'\\' The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to present Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew. The campaign also was to unveil its revamped Web site. One of its features will allow users to download event-specific posters or placards for campaign events. ? ? - USATodayAd-Bush NSC.pdf [/TEXT].\\n[ANSWER]\\nThe attribute that classifies the Text as \"sensitive\" is \"Personal Information\".

The council includes several prominent permanent members drawn from the business and academic communities, to which we add distinguished guests with expertise in areas of interest to us on an ad hoc basis. Several of our top executives attend these meetings. I am hoping that you might help us in two ways. Irwin tells me that your headquarters building is innovative and has many features that it would be well worth our while to know about and to study. Would it be possible for you to arrange a tour for a few of our executives, both from the US and the UK, say on the morning of October 30? Second, we understand from Irwin and from the press that you have done wonders in reinvigorating and revitalizing the BA staff. I am hoping that you might be willing to share some of the secrets of your success with us, perhaps at an informal buffet lunch at our new London headquarters on October 31, or at some other time on that day that might be more convenient for you. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on what you have achieved at BA, in a short time and in a tough market.

This brought to mind a question to ask you: Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business Development Offices? I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit.

Twice in the last three months I have run into the Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by Stan Horton who had decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when AGA \"kicked\" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of sub membership for around 85K. AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got back to them as promised. This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron\\'s oldest customers and friends will be calling Lay. It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza. In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year. Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM. In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM\\'s problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA\\'s with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on the company\\'s liquidity position. Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The same could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall \"guidance\" question. Let\\'s take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that\\'s ok with you.

Charles does make a good point about the deference language. As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance.

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants). Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing. Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day. Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices. Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic. It\\'s attached. Apologies, it\\'s quick and dirty, but it provides the basics. Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling. Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Unfortunately, that process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate. Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA. Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to be held the first week of Jan. I would like to handle all of these consistently and had planned to include Dutch\\'s promotion in this discussion. I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Questions the report raises for Enron: Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance sector? Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks to IT systems. The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year. Discussions with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value. If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as $13K per year. An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the LLC\\'s governance body to ensure Enron\\'s needs were addressed. Archie Dunham, CONOCO\\'s Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council recommends it at the 6 June meeting. Current coordination: The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO. Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative. Recent DOJ action regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that anti-trust will not be an issue. Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them. Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT protection efforts in next two weeks. Recommendation: Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector\\'s efforts - As Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a \"one-stop-shop\" format is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve Largent and Chip Pickering. After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next week. Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine whether to proceed further. There is a general perception that committee leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported legislation. In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines. As the drafts progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case. A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal siting. However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant interest groups not willing to go along. Cong. DeLay\\'s staff also tried to link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO. There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the minimalist package. There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market rates. Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others. As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up occurs. In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday. That package will have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and reformulated gasoline.

The oil belonged to Tosco. We had/have a contract to haul this oil for Tosco and were performing through Cummings. We outsourced our crude oil hauling function in California to Cummings and other companies last year, and many of our former crude drivers went to work for Cummings and these companies. The oil has gone into navigable waters and has reached the Pacific Ocean (during spawning season). This incident is on the front page of today\\'s L.A. Times Metro Section. ACCORDING TO ED ATTANASIO, NEITHER EOTT NOR ENRON IS MENTIONED IN THE TIMES COVERAGE. It is quite possible that Tosco will seek indemnity from us (in connection with this incident) under the terms of our hauling contract with them. The liabilities here for Tosco could be very significant. Ed Attanasio is monitoring this situation closely. We need to be sensitive to this situation for a number of reasons. Someone may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter. Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard. At this juncture, we need to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter. Until further notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty Cunningham . Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver. We should otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further comment at this time. Also, Lori and Molly, we will need to decide very soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate time, we should see what Baird thinks. We will look to Cummings and their insurance carriers to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don\\'t have enough information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may have in this matter. Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and advise on this ASAP. Please advise if there are any questions. Thanks.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing. I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM\\'s implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc). I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids. This is something we don\\'t want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated. Perhaps in Enron\\'s promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

I just wanted to warn you that I\\'m not sure this is in Enron\\'s long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you\\'d like to talk more about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC\\'s desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

I cannot give you a personal recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a trade secret or as a patented commodity. I ultimately struck a compromise position by filing my own \"provisional patent application.\" This establishes the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent? or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys. Of these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for your son\\'s software idea. He talked as though he had a particular specialty in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive. He practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408) 282-1856. I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office. Basic information and forms can be downloaded from there. Two other, newer sites might also intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of intellectual property, patents, etc. They are: pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) yet2come.com Hope this is helpful.

I have asked Paul Portney to review \"the lay of the land\" in the environmental policy area. 4. Since we couldn\\'t locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on this subject. 5. I couldn\\'t get anyone on the \"monopoly-too-big-and-powerful\" question, although I am still trying. I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply picture.

It is just not the same to have Jeff say it is okay that the AG of California wants to put Ken in a cell with Spike! I strongly believe we need to give Ken a forum too, as he has been at the center of alot of the recent noise. I still believe a video with both of them is the right way to go...The State of Enron. I think Jeff\\'s Corner is a great idea too...can\\'t we do both?

We\\'re also looking to increase your exposure with employees. We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a couple of weeks ago. It\\'s called \"Jeff\\'s Corner\" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 99.9% of our employees. This is how it will work. We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking about what\\'s top of mind at that moment. The tone and style will be like your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and conversational. We suggest the first topic be \"The State of Enron.\" There is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we\\'ve taken as a company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about the widespread re-deployment efforts. These recent events are beginning to affect morale. Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we\\'re on the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year. You\\'ve helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force. Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost. We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly. The nice thing about this medium is we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you speak to employees gives the message credibility. Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc. We\\'d like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you\\'d like to discuss. I\\'ve checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this now. I will check your calendar with Sherri. Let me know if you have any questions.
