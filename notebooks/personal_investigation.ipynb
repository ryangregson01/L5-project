We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.

The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now.  We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,  and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.  We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together.  Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.  This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance.  We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress.  A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me).

The USTR raised the issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session.\\nAs planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight.\\nLater today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request.\\nNext week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services.\\nShe has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you.\\nWe have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward.  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.  This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.\\nFollowing that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting.\\nThe last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.  I had planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us.\\nWell, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point.\\nThese are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.\\nJoe.\\nResponse: The text does contain personal information, but it is in a professional\",\n"," '177181': '\\nNow answer:\\nMessage: See natural gas price article below.

My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected.  It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \"fault\" for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points.  Whoever is blamed might not really matter.  My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West.  This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets.  Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets.  Commissioner Massey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done.  FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity  and intrastate take away capacity (which, by the way, doesn\\'t appear to address storage).  Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport costs.

Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it was less than a dollar in other areas.  He then noted that the high gas cost would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must act regarding the high transport differentials- \"We will never get a handle on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices\".  That opened the floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner Breathitt of FERC\\'s technical conference (notice of which issued today) on the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy of infrastructure within CA.  She said that this would shed light on basis differentials and gas prices.\\nFreudian slip?  Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall below 7%).  Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen.  \\nRegarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., Stages 1, 2 or 3): Hebert opined \"Most of the time\". Breathitt said \"Likely 80-85% of the time\".

In addition, there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners.\\nHIghlights\\nChairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region to support sec. 102.Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could be done; the witnesses just said \"cost plus a reasonable profit\" and said leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last week\\'s soft price cap is much better.Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken recently. The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \"help is on the way\" in the form of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat contentious at times.\\nPlease advise if you have any questions or would like further details..\\nResponse: The text does not contain personal information.</s>',\n"," '176483_0': '\\nNow answer:\\nMessage: No.  We have reallocated some of the responsibilities, but Cindy has a significant part of the HR organization and continues to manage Community Relations, so her title is accurate.

'' Leading the world in  innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create  many quality jobs.'' \\nThe purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to  present Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the  issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew.

Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). \\nJust think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model.

In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have   taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies   and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the   loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less   (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be   sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in   Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is   non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have   discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to   potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.   The reason: the vast majority of BLM\\'s problems stem from actions taken   by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA\\'s with private   parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which   although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on   the company\\'s liquidity position.\\n   Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in   Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken   or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an   effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor   confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.\\n   This is simply an overall \"guidance\" question.

Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their message was simple (and simplistic):\\nEl Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.\\nKen Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.  It\\'s attached.  Apologies, it\\'s quick and dirty, but it provides the basics.\\nObviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling.\\nFinally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.\\nBest,Jeff.\\nResponse: The text does contain personal information, but it is in a professional',\n"," '193686_1': '\\nNow answer:\\nMessage: Dutch requested a meeting with me today and I gave him the scoop on the promotion.

Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks to IT systems.  The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year.  Discussions with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value.  \\nIf Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as $13K per year.  An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the LLC\\'s governance body to ensure Enron\\'s needs were addressed.  Archie Dunham, CONOCO\\'s Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council recommends it at the 6 June  meeting.\\nCurrent coordination:\\nThe legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO.  Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative.  Recent DOJ action regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that anti-trust will not be an issue.  Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them.\\nMike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT protection efforts in next two weeks. \\nRecommendation:\\nEnron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector\\'s efforts - As Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a \"one-stop-shop\" format is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums. \\nPete---------------------- Forwarded by Pete Van De Gohm/HOU/EES on 02/26/2001 08:02 AM ---------------------------\\nMarshall Nichols <mnichols@npc.org>@listmail.npc.org> on 02/25/2001 06:59:43 PM\\n -  CIP CSC Draft 2-25-01.pdf.\\nResponse: The text does contain personal information in a professional context.

The oil belonged to Tosco.  We had/have a contract to haul this oil for Tosco and were performing through Cummings.  We outsourced our crude oil hauling function in California to Cummings and other companies last year, and many of our former crude drivers went to work for Cummings and these companies.  The oil has gone into navigable waters and has reached the Pacific Ocean (during spawning season).  This incident is on the front page of today's L.A. Times Metro Section. ACCORDING TO ED ATTANASIO,  NEITHER EOTT NOR ENRON IS MENTIONED IN THE TIMES COVERAGE.  It is quite possible that Tosco will seek indemnity from us (in connection with this incident) under the terms of our hauling contract with them.   The liabilities here for Tosco could be very significant.  Ed Attanasio is monitoring this situation closely.  \\n  We need to be sensitive to this situation for a number of reasons.  Someone may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter.  Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard.  At this juncture, we need to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter.  Until further notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty Cunningham .  Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver.  We should otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further comment at this time.  Also, Lori and Molly,  we will need to decide very soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate time, we should see what Baird thinks.  We will look to Cummings and their insurance carriers  to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don't have enough information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may have in this matter.  Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and advise on this ASAP.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.\\nMartin.\\nResponse: The text does not contain personal information.\\n\\nThe text is\",\n"," '52170_1': '\\nNow answer:\\nMessage: Martin, Lance\\nWhat do you think?\\nVince.\\nResponse: The text does not contain personal information.</s>',\n"," '52170_2': \"\\nNow answer:\\nMessage: Vince,\\n  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorsethe nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.I just wanted to warn you that I'm not surethis is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explainwhy.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talkmore about this.\\n  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricingand specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJMimplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatilityand reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, thePJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deemsis out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The factthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-settingsoftware to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhatunfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that thePJM ISO decides what prices it would likefor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is nota transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buythe risk management services that Enron provides.  Theonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market isthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control areato meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay theimports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.\\n  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on theEast Coast.  This will effectively mean little importsto the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated atthe discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.It effectively kills off the development of risk management atthe wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much lessprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigatedprices.\\n  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternativeform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reducesprice volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they justget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-serviceregulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-serviceprices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.\\n  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sourcesof benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-sideinvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  Anecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflectactual conditions in the market (including the extent of market powerexercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for marketparticipants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJMmodel is just way to have a market in name without achieving anysignificant benefits to consumers or energy traders.\\nFrank.\\nResponse: The text does contain personal information.

I cannot give you a personal  recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  position by filing my own \"provisional patent application.\"  This establishes  the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  your son\\'s software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  282-1856. I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:   pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) yet2come.com Hope this is helpful.

It\\'s called \"Jeff\\'s Corner\" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 99.9% of our employees.  \\nThis is how it will work.

You\\'ve helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force.  Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost.  \\nWe recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly.

This approach maximizes the utilization of the existing infrastructure (reduces idle or redundant facilities) and gives customers the ability to more closely tailor their energy purchases to the their needs.\\nThere are barriers to achieve this vision. It is in the interest of the governments to work in a common protocol to progress rapidly.\\nDevelopment of infrastructure .- Still not well developed. Needs to attract project financing. At this stage, the customers have few alternatives. Government policy should be to allow access above and beyond what was initially contracted to justify the financing. Terms of financing have to be honored. Long term, competing facilities (pipelines, refineries, transmission lines, power plants) will be fighting for customers.\\nThreat. Control of these facilities: Petrobras through the BBPL; YPF in Argentina \\nCross-border Licensing.- Very time consuming, bureaucratic delays to grant, export, import, re-export permitting.  Present regime cannot accommodate  the rapid transaction scenario which will be required to support real integration.\\nCuiaba Power plant,- As of today we have not received all the permits. Latest issue is the Bolivian-Argentina border dispute due to YPF denial to accommodate a transaction of Bolivian gas into Argentina.\\nOperationally, the plant will receive daily instructions from Brasilia. The gas supply from Argentina/Bolivia, including spot market transaction  has to be nominated within 48 hours notice.  There are no mechanisms to change quickly the approved volumes.\\nCommercial entities need to be given the opportunity to export/import to aggregate the requirements of different suppliers various customers.\\nTaxation.- Transfer taxes (i.e. receipt taxes ,stamp taxes) for each step down the chain needs to be eliminated for commercial entities, particularly for export transactions.\\nThese commercial entities buy pieces of the services on behalf of the ultimate customer (act as their agent) and package the final offer. The objective to  reduce the cost of the product, which would not be met by adding a further taxable event. There should not be  more, nor any less taxes because of the services of the middle company, except for the larger amount of income taxes generated by increase commercial activity.\\nMoney Transfers.-  Central Bank Controls to authorize the transfer of currency needs to be made more agile. Currently these procedures are very time consuming and cumbersome (Brazil -- I am not as familiar with the other countries)\\nThis is affecting us in Cuiaba. The Central Bank has not approved the gas contract, specifically the Take-or-pay provision that has a one-year make up period. They want a longer make-up period, but that was negotiated with YPF as part of the larger agreement. YPF may agree but at a higher price. The Central Bank does not want to send US$ out of the country, so they view TOP as a devise of paying for a commodity never received. So they are meddling in contract negotiations. \\nBelow are other notes\\nThanks\\nJose.\\nResponse: The text does contain personal information.

I am very comfortable with issues for Argentina and think we need to focus mainly on the stamp tax issue.  Secondly, I would raise the issue of open access pipelines, especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to Argentina.  The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a matter of changing the law, changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the gas to flow on it\\'s section of pipe which I understand is not under the jurisdiction of Enargas. What can the government do?\\nJB.- I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation, how these pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator.  If it is determined that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network, in time a bypass pipeline may be built. But an immediate solution needs to be developed.\\nIn Brazil, I am not sure what to raise.  On Monday we have meetings with the Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy and Mines.  What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private?  Myself in public? or the Minister of External Affairs?\\nJB.- For background, the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising dollarization of their economy, \"desnacionaliza?ao\". Their concern is not the US$, it is control. It is that the Old-boys network in Brazil Government/Industry, has been disturbed by the New-boys taking control of high visibility sectors, Banking, telecommunications, energy.  \\nMalan, Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be active in direct investment and support of big projects.Complaints about BNDES (Brazilian development bank) lending to foreigners for privatization (Recent AES incident)Tourinho, Mines and Energy-- pushing a new privatization model -- sale of stock at the market, not sale of control to a given company. This allows the existing management to stay in place. If it is the Secretary of Energy, Carraro, his big mission is to coordinate the developement of emergengy thermal plants. Big Picture Governement Porgram -- Petrobras provides that gas;  Eletrobras buys and remarkets the electric energy;  BNDES provides the financing  --- All within the family.\\nForeign companies will not play by the rules of the old network. Enron has been actively complaining about the gas policy under Petrobras control.\\nThe One Issue I would raise is the lack of competition in the gas sector. Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas. There cannot be true competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants, price setters, gas power plants.\\nAs a note, there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of 51% control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline. What Petrobras is doing is locking-up the capacity long term, and building a second pipeline.\\nOf equal importance is our meeting with the Sao Paulo Governor.  What issues do we have or what do you want me to say to him regarding our assets in this area.  Even if it\\'s to compliment on something, that\\'s fine.\\nJB.- The State of Sao Paulo, Mario Covas team are to be congratulated by the skillful manner that they have conducted the gradual privatization of energy sector.  Covas is very influential. His current battle deals with tax reforms in Brazil. He is fighting a system of tax-preferences in other states to attract industries, which ultimately creates a Federal burden and consequently a Sao Paulo burden.\\nThe Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance.\\nI assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time. \\nJB.- There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them. I would be interested on what you pick up\\nThanks.\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 02/15/2000 01:45 PM ---------------------------.\\nResponse: The text does contain personal information in a professional context.

We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities.  However, while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?]  Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market.  \\nWe are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market.  [deleted text] Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year.\\nThe EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.\\nOur Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London.\\nBy May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a part of Enron Europe.\\nEBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  by year end.\\nThe Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months.\\nIn the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. \\nNick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shapiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets.\\nWe have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come.

Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15.

The amendment does not surprise me though. \\n In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in \\'91, we developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included--the thinking by the various State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones, funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately unearthed.  It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and consultation process....not only when objects were unearthed, but simply putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to construction.  (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans together..Haha!!)   As I said, I\\'ve not read the amendment , but hopefully it only legally requires \\'notice\\'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing law, I\\'ve rarely seen  a \\'notice\\' that didn\\'t crack the door or sound the alarm of further buerocratic opportunity!\\nFor your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and he\\'s a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ; yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to \\'perceived economic opportunity\\'.   Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match, and is proud of it!! --which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes you--he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and \"plays\"in whatever stage opportunity is presented him--as long as he can be the center of attention.  The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has his own!!  Check it out--it\\'s a hoot!!  He has been chief for about 25 years (and I\\'m guessing he\\'s maybe in his early 50\\'s).  The Seminoles have recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely a \"My way or the highway\" kind of guy--he loves you, hates you, or ignores you--and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn\\'t like, he\\'ll know no limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!! No Joke!\\nI don\\'t recognize the other names on the list, but I think it\\'s clear from both the beurocratic issues, as well as the specific tribal issues incident to each affected tribe, everything associated with the process should be executed with all of this in mind.  I\\'d be happy to speak with the project\\'s lawyer to discuss this further, if information beyond that set forth above would be helpful.\\nThanks!\\n--Christie.\\n----- Forwarded by Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2001 08:53 AM -----.\\nResponse: The text does contain personal information.</s>',\n"," '175669_2': '\\nNow answer:\\nMessage: Alice:\\nJanus Research sent the enclosed letters to me;  I understand that theyhave been modified per your discussions with them.

The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now.  We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,  and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.  We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together.  Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.  This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance.  We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress.  A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me).  I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask.

Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples.  The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line.  Hoarding capacity to drive up price  may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids.  FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance, but in a non-public way.\\nThere were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30.  I would like to put the following in these comments:\\nEvidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.  The best folks can do is make up stuff.We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring.  But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines.The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently the case.\\nWe also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.
