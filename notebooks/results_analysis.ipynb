This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (althoughinterrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is thesubject matter of its counterclaim.\n","First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) chargesto the market.  In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during thelast quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the \"cost to themarket\" from the  EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day aheadmarket clearing price to the  individual  hourly variances.  This cost tothe market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account thefact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accountsto get a net amount of underreporting.  This underreported amount is thenallocated to all providers of physical load within a service territorythrough the assessment of UFE charges.  Thus whatever the ultimate cost wasdetermined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount.\n","Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, inSCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased.  Thisclaim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market inthe way of UFE charges.  What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES andEEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy whichthey reported to the ISO.  EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more thanthe amount which EES and EEMC reported.  SCE calculated the PX credit basedon the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC arenot entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC,purchased those volumes.\n","It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter ofSCE's counterclaim.  SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PXcredit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase.  SCEis claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO.  WhileSCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the resultof  EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of itscounterclaim.\n","Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece ofinformation  to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreportingof volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DAcustomers those customers' full usage.

There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues.  One of them exludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, specifically including connection fees.  In the example in the e-mail, the issue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that are then transferred to the utility.

ERCOT will present its agreement and procedures and EPSA will present a list of problems that members have had.  Enron worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs.  EEI will also make a presentation.  (Additionally, as you are probably aware, over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotline and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconnection issues -- this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issues.)\n","At the end of the Nov. 1 meeting, other meeting participants will have a brief amount of time to raise issues.  Donna Fulton will attend for Enron.  FERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interconnection procedures and parts of an IA (results due to FERC Dec 14).  We will then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec. 21.  \n","FERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings; therefore, it will most likely not be dealing with the tax gross-up and crediting issues yet.  It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rulemaking.  (We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most problematic part of interconnection negotiations, but this is the way FERC wants to proceed.  FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders when disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecuted.)\n","By way of background on ERCOT, as I understand it, ERCOT basically rolls in the interconnection costs (network-type upgrades) to the entire grid through TCOS (an uplift).  However, TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited -- ERCOT has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the best interest of the grid.  Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT to this method.  We will need to formulate Enron's view in the next phase of the interconnection proceeding.\n","For Thurs. meeting, I think Donna should raise these issues:-- While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminate the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and over, the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business circumstances (for example, the notice to proceed that we have been including.)\n","-- While having timelines and procedures are fine, the larger problem has been getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures (for example, Entergy was one of the first to file procedures, yet seems to have a problem sticking to their timelines.)  This yet again means that RTOs are critical to stop the discriminatory practices and to provide incentives to treat us as customers.\n","--There needs to be more discussion on best practice No.2 below -- Energy resource or capacity resource.  This should be reviewed in the context of FERC's NOPR on icap (Enron just submitted comments that \"capacity\" as a separate payment is not necessary in functioning markets.  In addition, \"capacity\" is not a separately required \"payment\" in most parts of the US outside of current ISOs (ERCOT does not have icap)).\n","Attached is the ANOPR, ERCOT IA and procedures.

Although I did not see the word \"congestion\", the implication of what I read is that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion impacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in \"but for\" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude.  Did I?\n","I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgotten about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this upgrade and \"but for\" stuff, and then \"gives\" it to the utility, are there taxes due on the \"gift\"?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the taxes on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned over to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to \"waste\" on an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dept (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was considering.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection to address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC process?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process?  \n","I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents to the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, \"all generators are good and benefit the ratepayers.\")  On fundamental grounds they will resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the insult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades), they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine strongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it.  And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problems around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considering adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the grid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Because all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we supported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now developing in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system upgrades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the \"gift\" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmission system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nice if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of dealing with the tax issues in this NOPR?\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning.\n","HP contacts to date: \n","Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales ManagerHouston, TX#(713)-439-5587(Gerry Cashiola's boss)\n","Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX#(713)-439-5555(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)\n","Greg Pyle, Solution Control ManagerSoutheast RegionAustin, TX (#(512)-257-5735(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)\n","Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliancesAustin, TX#(512)-257-5736(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)\n","Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services SolutionsCupertino, CA#(408)-447-5240(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting)\n","Matt,\n","On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).\n","On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:\n","1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?\n","2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)\n","3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   \n","In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:\n","Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.\n","Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central Region.\n"," In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points:  \n"," a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)\n"," b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron\n"," Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person.  \n","We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities. \n","Sarah-Joy HunterEnron CorporationGlobal Strategic Sourcing - Business Development#(713)-345-6541\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.\n","1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. \n","2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.\n","3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.\n","I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you.

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money.

Karate One Studio on Van Ness Avenue may be owed for a self-defense class it conducted for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Of course, PG&E may only have to pay pennies on the dollar to the small fry, since that's how bankruptcies work. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff WriterFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/04/20/MN190213.DTL&type=3Dnews Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead to a \"long and costly\" bankruptcy. But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis.

Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again. A resolution passed 48-7 asked President George W. Bush, Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restore the regulation of natural gas that ended in 1992. Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years. We're not seeing adequate action from the federal government,\" said the author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Atwater. Republicans refused to vote for the resolution, complaining that it was an attack on the GOP Bush administration. Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E. Frank received $760,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $1.35 million last year. And Edison Mission Energy CEO Alan J. Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand. The council voted 3-2 Wednesday to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy plants in the city.

Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power\n","SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -\n","FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and\n","Electric Company\n","There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effectPacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had onenergy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few usefulfacts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may bedriving the state's energy costs higher.\n","Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was payingroughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct resultof the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, evenlaudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsidesof utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governorshould know better.\n","Consider the facts:\n","--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest\n","investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to\n","below investment grade by every major rating agency.\n","Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to\n","sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.\n","--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state\n","Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power\n","purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the\n","Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an\n","ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could\n","be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in\n","the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the\n","full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional\n","generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or\n","have under contract, to meet customer demand.\n","However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of\n","state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full\n","net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know\n","for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say\n","how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will\n","the ISO.)\n","--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n","informed the Independent System Operator that it could not\n","force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,\n","both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.\n","  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to  schools and hospitals.\n","  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.\n","  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the  rate-cap measure is \"deeply flawed\" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or  December 2003.\n","  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through  December 2002. \"It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,\" he said because it \"creates  tremendous uncertainty\" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance  new projects such as a new transmission line.\n","  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that  review the plans. \n","  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution.

The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money.

But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis. Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid $950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 1999. Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $1.3 million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis. In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they did receive raises. Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors.\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis and U.S. lawmakers call for price caps on power LOS ANGELES -- Half of California's congressional delegation gathered with Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again.

Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years.

Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E. Frank received $760,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $1.35 million last year. And Edison Mission Energy CEO Alan J. Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand.

It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know\n","for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say\n","how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will\n","the ISO.)\n","--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n","informed the Independent System Operator that it could not\n","force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,\n","both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money. A San Francisco ice cream parlor, a costume store, a psychiatrist's office and a karate studio are among a number of small businesses that should be receiving payments from the near bankrupt utility.

Karate One Studio on Van Ness Avenue may be owed for a self-defense class it conducted for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Of course, PG&E may only have to pay pennies on the dollar to the small fry, since that's how bankruptcies work. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff WriterFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/04/20/MN190213.DTL&type=3Dnews Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead to a \"long and costly\" bankruptcy. But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis.

Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer.

Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again. A resolution passed 48-7 asked President George W. Bush, Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restore the regulation of natural gas that ended in 1992. Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years. We're not seeing adequate action from the federal government,\" said the author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Atwater. Republicans refused to vote for the resolution, complaining that it was an attack on the GOP Bush administration. Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E. Frank received $760,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $1.35 million last year. And Edison Mission Energy CEO Alan J. Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand. The council voted 3-2 Wednesday to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy plants in the city. Register staff writers, The Associated Press and Knight Ridder Newspapers contributed to this report. \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Friday, April 20, 2001 \n","Shed light on costs Unfortunately, California citizens will remain in the dark for at least another month about the details of Gov. Gray Davis' long-term contracts with power producers.\n","This is the sort of crisis the public needs to scrutinize and for which the Public Records Act was designed.\n","At a Tuesday hearing in a Los Angeles County Superior Court in Pasadena on whether the documents should be released under the California Public Records Act, Judge Michael J. Byrne said the case could better be heard in a Los Angeles court.The case was brought by Judicial Watch, a Washington-based public interest law firm with its West Coast office in San Marino. \"The case was reset for May 22 in a Los Angeles County Superior Court in the city of Los Angeles although we're going to try to move it up a bit,\" Judicial Watch and General Counsel Larry Klayman told us. Mr. Klayman remains hopeful. \"We're confident any judge who sees this will have to release the documents,\" he said.A similar but separate case, brought by several newspapers, will be heard May 18 in a San Diego Superior Court. \"This is a huge financial burden on the taxpayers without an opportunity for the taxpayers to scrutinize the terms,\" Hal Fuson, chairman of the government affairs committee of the California Newspaper Publishers Association, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \"The general climate surrounding the governor's approach to this has been one of secrecy.\"The governor's position is that releasing the details now could make it harder for the state to get the best prices for electricity. But given that the governor has mismanaged this crisis so far, it's clear that this is precisely the sort of crisis the public needs to scrutinize and for which the Public Records Act was designed.The governor should end this legal wrangling and release the documents to which citizens are entitled. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","End To Deregulation of Nevada Power\n","CARSON CITY, Nev.

Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power\n","SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -\n","FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and\n","Electric Company\n","There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effectPacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had onenergy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few usefulfacts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may bedriving the state's energy costs higher.\n","Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was payingroughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct resultof the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, evenlaudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsidesof utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governorshould know better.\n","Consider the facts:\n","--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest\n","investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to\n","below investment grade by every major rating agency.\n","Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to\n","sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.\n","--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state\n","Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power\n","purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the\n","Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an\n","ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could\n","be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in\n","the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the\n","full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional\n","generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or\n","have under contract, to meet customer demand.\n","However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of\n","state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full\n","net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know\n","for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say\n","how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will\n","the ISO.)\n","--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n","informed the Independent System Operator that it could not\n","force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,\n","both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Due to press of other matters I will be brief.\n","First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  \n","Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.\n","Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  \n","Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. \n","Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.\n","Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  \n","Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.\n","Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.\n","P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.\n","Mark\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Let me explain\twhy.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk\tmore about this.\n","\t  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing\tand specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM\timplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility\tand reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the\tPJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a\t%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems\tis out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact\tthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)\tThen the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting\tsoftware to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat\tunfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the\tPJM ISO decides what prices it would like\tfor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not\ta transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy\tthe risk management services that Enron provides.  The\tonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is\tthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area\tto meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the\timports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.\n","\t  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the\tEast Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports\tto the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at\tthe discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service\tmitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.\tIt effectively kills off the development of risk management at\tthe wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less\tprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated\tprices.\n","\t  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative\tform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces\tprice volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just\tget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service\tregulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service\tmitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service\tprices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.\n","\t  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources\tof benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side\tinvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A\tnecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect\tactual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power\texercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market\tparticipants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM\tmodel is just way to have a market in name without achieving any\tsignificant benefits to consumers or energy traders.\n","\tFrank\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, 10/4/00). Such discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the lawsuit said. \n","The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. \n","Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. \n","\"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the lawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. \n","The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 percent are women. \n","Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. \n","The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft. \n","\"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are \"systemic in nature, and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's operations,\" the lawsuit maintains. \n","'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged\n","The complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them.\"\n","The lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation system\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\" Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. \n","\"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee with a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to resign, the complaint said. \n","\"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. \n","\"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal popularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working for different managers. \n","In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries \"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit said. \n","Furthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees. \n","By Nan Netherton\n","Copyright , 2000 by The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., Washington D.C.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15.

I am very comfortable with issues for Argentina and think we need to focus mainly on the stamp tax issue.  Secondly, I would raise the issue of open access pipelines, especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to Argentina.  The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a matter of changing the law, changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the gas to flow on it's section of pipe which I understand is not under the jurisdiction of Enargas. What can the government do?\n","JB.- I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation, how these pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator.  If it is determined that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network, in time a bypass pipeline may be built. But an immediate solution needs to be developed.\n","In Brazil, I am not sure what to raise.  On Monday we have meetings with the Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy and Mines.  What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private?  Myself in public? or the Minister of External Affairs?\n","JB.- For background, the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising dollarization of their economy, \"desnacionaliza?ao\". Their concern is not the US$, it is control. It is that the Old-boys network in Brazil Government/Industry, has been disturbed by the New-boys taking control of high visibility sectors, Banking, telecommunications, energy.  \n","Malan, Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be active in direct investment and support of big projects.Complaints about BNDES (Brazilian development bank) lending to foreigners for privatization (Recent AES incident)Tourinho, Mines and Energy-- pushing a new privatization model -- sale of stock at the market, not sale of control to a given company. This allows the existing management to stay in place. If it is the Secretary of Energy, Carraro, his big mission is to coordinate the developement of emergengy thermal plants. Big Picture Governement Porgram -- Petrobras provides that gas;  Eletrobras buys and remarkets the electric energy;  BNDES provides the financing  --- All within the family.\n","Foreign companies will not play by the rules of the old network. Enron has been actively complaining about the gas policy under Petrobras control.\n","The One Issue I would raise is the lack of competition in the gas sector. Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas. There cannot be true competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants, price setters, gas power plants.\n","As a note, there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of 51% control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline.

Even if it's to compliment on something, that's fine.\n","JB.- The State of Sao Paulo, Mario Covas team are to be congratulated by the skillful manner that they have conducted the gradual privatization of energy sector.  Covas is very influential. His current battle deals with tax reforms in Brazil. He is fighting a system of tax-preferences in other states to attract industries, which ultimately creates a Federal burden and consequently a Sao Paulo burden.\n","The Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance.\n","I assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time. \n","JB.- There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them.

Since I am on vacation (or at least trying to be) I didn't go back into the office looking for you later in the day.  The following are my last thoughts regarding Government and Reg Affairs people and organisational issues.  I will leave them with you and the others do with as you like.  John T.\n","0)\tBackground:  Cross-border issues in power and EU vs. the Germans and Dutch in Gas will likely be the big issues in the\tnext 12 to 18 months on the continent.  We have the potential to add as much value via GovRegAffairs activity on the\tcontinent in the next 12 months as through any commercial activity.  Much of this activity will have to be EU focused.  In\tpower especially we have gotten almost - not quite all - but almost all that we can hope to get exclusively from national \tlevel work.  (Italy and Spain are of course big exceptions.)  Gas is and always has been much more of a Europe-wide\ttheme than a national theme.  We will have to carefully manage our public GRA message and approach to take tough\tpositions without creating unneeded enemies.  We should look for local national allies where possible.  We cannot be the\t\tonly voice in any country supporting a major position.  If there are no local forces supporting the position, we need to\tfind/create some allies.  It cannot be Enron vs. Germany; or, even worse, Enron and EU vs Germany (or Switzerland, or\twherever).  Loss of momentum at this time would be an error; however, focus would be an accomplishment.  Each issue\twill need a simultaneous AND co-ordinated EU and local effort. \n","1)\tStyles and the EU Office:  I am convinced that Peter Styles is the most important single continent based GRA asset at\tthis time and for the next 18 to 24 months.  Everyone including me has their own stories about Peter - not all positive.\tBut he is the right man, at the right time at the right place.  Within the bounds of what is managerially and financially\tresponsible, it is important to keep the Styles-force working for Enron at the EU level.  Beyond his linguistic skills he\tunderstands absolutely what Enron needs to make money on the continent.  Of course, we should begin thinking about\tPeter's EVENTUAL retirement.  We should never allow anyone to be permanently as essential as Peter has become.\tBUT, right now he is essential.\n","2)\tGerman GRA Activities:  Permanent resource (100%) should become Jan Haizmann (or however you spell it).  He is\tabrupt and offensive to Anglo-Saxons - but then, he is very German - and the directness that some of us have come to\tappreciate about the Germans is often mistaken as rudeness by those who have not worked with them much.  I have gotten\tconsistently positive feed-back from senior German colleagues especially about his performance with senior German\tofficials such as the head of the Federal Cartel Office.  My understanding is that Haizmann wants to move to Frankfurt.  If\tthis is true, I would encourage it.  There are no German official offices (other than the Embassy) in London.\n","\tWe have, I believe, all agreed that Paul Hennemeyer is more of a self-propelled project guy than a team player.  Thus, I \twould agree that probably mid- to long-term he should move on within Enron to other Hennemeyer sized projects.  But,\tin the immediate future, he has several very important projects going on in German speaking Europe.  Additionally, with\ta new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up, with renewed interest in Austria and with the \tnecessity to engage somewhat in Switzerland (regarding transit), it does not look to me like we should let Paul leave too\tquickly.  As a somewhat mentor to Haizmann, passing off relationships in an orderly manner, ensuring that projects do not\tfall through the cracks, etc. there is still much for Paul to do. It will be, however, necessary to give him a clear picture of\this future or Enron will lose him entirely.  An open ended \"project boy\" job will not keep Paul indefinitely.  Let's not lose\tPaul to Enron even if we have to slowly move him out of Europe.\n","3)\tLars Atenhoefer:  Lars is much in demand by Gregor and others for his unique brand of consulting based commercial work.\tI continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than 50% GRA front-end for Switzerland.  He would be glad to\tdo that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus.  Switzerland does not/will not justify full-time GRA\tsupport; but, we must get more engaged there.  Less for our Swiss business than for our cross-border business and for\tcontinued grid and water power access.  The liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held. Everything going on in\tSwitzerland now by real players is based on the failure of that vote. Important to work with Gregor and Eric to ensure that\tLars continues to see a variety of opportunities in Enron.  His academic and professional preparation is perfect for a GRA\tperson.  He belongs to Gregor and Eric.  I recommend talking with them about him.\n","4)\tDoug Wood:  I do not see a mid- or long-term role for Doug Wood on the continent.  He only speaks English and currently\thas little feel for the continent - which is neither American nor Britain.  English only players will ALWAYS fall behind\tlocals.  In every country where we need to have an impact, the impact MUST be in local language and should be with a\tlocal national.  GRA work is political (i.e., irrational and emotional). Brits are Europeans and Americans are people too \tdoesn't wash with local politicians.  The fact that some locals are willing to speak English is a trick.  The real business -\tparticularly regulatory and political business - is always done in local language.  Local GRA people, local country \tmanagers, local lawyers, etc. are not going to suffer an English only player gladly.  Let's be realistic about this.  Doug\tWood has no future on the continent.\n","5)\tResearch Specialists (and other such creatures):  We should not have such creatures.  That is a go nowhere job and it\tattracts go nowhere people.  More seriously, it would be a fantastic place for a direct out of the university eager Analyst\tto get an introduction to Enron before hitting a commercial desk.  That will also help ensure that future commercial teams\twill better understand the role of GRA.  The continuity argument doesn't wash.  Many commercial Analyst and Associates\trotate leaving continuity problems behind.  I am getting rid of my personal Research Specialist and will farm the work out\tin the future to rotating Analysts (watch out Gregor and Eric).  Reg Affairs should get rid of all of their Research Positions.\n","\tWe must ensure that enough first rotation Analysts are assigned to this task. I have several times in several different \tcountries seen Analyst level work outsourced to very highly paid consultants simply because GRA didn't have any\tresource.  Besides being expensive and wasteful, this costs a would be Analyst a great learning experience.  Perhaps\teach commercial country manager and each country specific GRA person should share a research analyst as a first\tround rotator.  All of our senior relationship work, etc. would be done much more professionally if that were the case and\tour consulting bills would fall.\n","6)\tCountry Managers:  Each country manager (such as Radmacher, Renggli, a hopefully soon to be new Italian one, etc.)\tshould be spending a meaningful (ca. 10 to 15%) of their time on GRA activities.  The commercial country manager should\tby definition have the best feel in Enron for what we need to do how and with whom in his/her country.  They must be told\tthat GRA leadership - together with you and the gas and power leadership executives - is part of their job. A new market\tmanager such as the future Italian country manager should consider GRA leadership an essential part of getting their\tmarket off of the ground.  Any commercial country manager who wants to 100% outsource GRA leadership in his/her\tcountry should be replaced.  Further, this should also reduce the need for too many VP and Sr Director level GRA people\tat this time.\n","7)\tItaly:  A Spaniard that speaks Italian is a good SHORT-term solution for Italy.  If we successfully hire a new Italian country\tmanager, he should get heavily involved in this initially.  Eventually, we will need a real-live Italian in Italy but we probably \tdon't need to look for him/her this quarter.  \n","8)\tLocal Politics, Local Language, Local National:  Should apply to:  Germany, The Netherlands, Austria/Switzerland \t(perhaps together, but then done by a German), France(&, perhaps Belgium), Spain, Italy.  I cannot imagine that we need any \tresource in former Communist Europe - Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, etc.  \n","I have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions; but, I am going to make this my final and conclusive list of GRA suggestions.  I look forward to working with you in this regard.  Already have engagements in the GRA space in Switzerland and Germany this year and am sure that there are many to come. Congratulations in you new role and best of wishes.  JT\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight.\n","Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request.\n","Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services.\n","She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you.\n","We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward.  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.  This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.\n","Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting.\n","The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.  I had planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us.\n","Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point.\n","These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.\n","Joe\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent).

A San Francisco ice cream parlor, a costume store, a psychiatrist's office and a karate studio are among a number of small businesses that should be receiving payments from the near bankrupt utility. After checking her books, ACT Costume Shop manager Callie Floor was surprised to find that the utility owes her $100 for a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. Karate One Studio on Van Ness Avenue may be owed for a self-defense class it conducted for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Of course, PG&E may only have to pay pennies on the dollar to the small fry, since that's how bankruptcies work. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff WriterFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/04/20/MN190213.DTL&type=3Dnews Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead to a \"long and costly\" bankruptcy. But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis. Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid $950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 1999. Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $1.3 million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they did receive raises. Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers.

Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again.

Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E.

Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes.

While it's understandable, evenlaudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsidesof utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governorshould know better.\n","Consider the facts:\n","--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest\n","investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to\n","below investment grade by every major rating agency.\n","Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to\n","sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.\n","--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state\n","Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power\n","purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the\n","Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an\n","ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could\n","be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in\n","the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the\n","full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional\n","generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or\n","have under contract, to meet customer demand.\n","However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of\n","state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full\n","net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know\n","for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say\n","how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will\n","the ISO.)\n","--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n","informed the Independent System Operator that it could not\n","force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,\n","both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

Midsize business owners are defined as thosewho normally spend $1,500 to $25,000 per month on electricity.  The studyshows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of $4,827 per monthon electricity.\n","The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United Statesconsistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customersatisfaction.  Likewise, these midsize business customers also report thelowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures, on average.  Midsizebusinesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage ($3,885 permonth on average), while those in New Hampshire, Nevada and Utah spend themost ($5,700 to $5,800 per month on average).

My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.\n","These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.\n","I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.

For example, the Texas insurance code has evolved from a vague \"duty of good faith & fair dealing\" standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing certain things detrimental to the insured.  Justin tells me English law, in this regard, consists only of precedential case law, but it still could be helpful.  Because of the commercial risk (outside the ambit of arbitration in the instance) it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United India from withholding this information which is critical to running these machines.   If, in fact,  there truly is a 50% chance of failure in these machines, yet they won't share that evidence with us, this is a commercial risk DPC can't afford, regardless of coverage and apart from the arbitration.  (I'm wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today).  Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction, United India did us the favor of bringing  suit in London Commercial Court earlier, and thus having availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirst's emphatic witness statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction, I think it is worth considering  if they continue to refuse to give us the report in response to Justin's latest correspondence.  I don't think we can afford to sit on our hands on this one.  Why don't you and Neil kick this around, (since you don't have enough to do already).Cheers,Michelle\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back.  \n","I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group.  It's attached.  Please take a look.  I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read.

List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ.The list also includes Hogan and Joskow  and Borenstein.  We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis.  However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., \"de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work.\"  Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the \"authors\" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course.  The analysis would not be a debate over \"To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc.\"  In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a \"Nixon goes to China\" scenario.  Please take a look at the list of participants.  Again, we can add to and subtract from the list.Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.)None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum.  It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan).The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project.  This is for two reasons:  1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study.If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project.\n","Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile.

Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.\n"," \n","General Observations\n"," \n","The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. \n"," \n","FERC Deliverables\n","A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  \n","The first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.\n","The next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.\n","The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  \n","One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are allowed)?          Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?\n","Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financial hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.\n","Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.\n","NERC and GISB\n","A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.\n","Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.\n","Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.\n","There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.\n","The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.\n","Let me know if you have any questions.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 0.0 .

This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for re-election and it is a big vacation week for staff...but here's what I am hearing:\n","As you may or may not know, we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summer's liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, WA.   \n","SENATE:  In June, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill (S. 2438) out of the Senate Commerce Committee, and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate.   Because of the hasty way in which S. 2438 was drafted and passed, there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made -- mostly things that were deal breakers for industry.  Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes, including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), John Breaux (D-LA), and Sam Brownback (R-KS).   From what I've learned since the accident, these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements.  Fortunately, most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident.   Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident...the El Paso incident just reinforces those.   The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October.  The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCain/Gorton legislation, and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations, get agreement from all sides on a bill, and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor.\n","HOUSE:   The House is moving a bit more slowly, but again, I'd expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat.  There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere, including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ).  Franks is now anxious to move legislation, as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility.   Before the accident, House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a \"consensus\" bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor.   I'm told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly.  Unlike our experience in the Senate, we have had significant input into the bill in advance, and expect something that we can live with -- and something more reasonable than the McCain bill.   With that said, there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident, so we'll have to see what kind of hand we're dealt in the next few weeks.  \n","Overall, I'd expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day.  In the absence of this accident, I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment, with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress' precious time.   Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process, so that everyone running for election in November can show that they've done something about this terrible tragedy.   With that said, there's still not that much time to get legislation through, so I'd say that there's still a chance it may not get done this year.   If I had to attach a number to it, I'd say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 50-60%.\n","2)  Gas supply to California:   I'll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you.   All I've heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line, notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly.   I'm sure the power crunch in California will put some counter-pressure on, but I just don't have good intelligence on this yet.\n","With all this said, I'm on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave I've taken for the birth of our new baby daughter, so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week.\n","If you have questions, please respond by e-mail, or leave a message on my voice mail at 202-466-9157.\n","Regards,\n","Jeff Keeler\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

In addition, MITI is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to consider the next stage of deregulation. \n","As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved. Recently, with the addition of Kimura, we have increased our level of contact with senior political figures in Japan.\n","Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enron's views on issues relating to the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity deregulation. We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist in the deregulation process in a positive way.\n","What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be structured in the future.\n","Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will receive a cabinet position if Gov. Bush is elected. As a result, Mr Lay currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in Japan. In the period prior to the Presidential election, we have an ideal opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese Government through Mr Lay.\n","A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government members would significantly increase Enron's profile in Japan and assist in conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation.\n","If Mr Lay were to visit Japan, possibly in late October or early November, we would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and arrange a number of high level commercial meetings.

I'd  be very grateful if you could pass along a nod of benign interest in  this.\n","We'd greatly appreciate Enron's support for the  proposed resolution of the tagging issue at the NERC Subcommittee tomorrow,  mainly because it should avoid what might otherwise be a messy contract dispute,  at FERC or elsewhere, between our organizations.? Without getting into the  details, my understanding of the issue under the energy purchase agreement has  to do with whether the change in NERC tagging that was required on June 1 (the  date when MoPEP started taking certain control area services from Western  Resources) affects Enron's obligation under the agreement to deliver energy to  the Associated Electric Cooperative transmission system.? MoPEP's view is  that Enron's obligations are unaffected, but some at Enron apparently have had a  different view.? Our belief is that the proposal that will be presented to  the Security Subcommittee will resolve the tagging matter such that both Enron  and MoPEP would regard any potential dispute on this issue as moot.\n","Sorry  for such short notice, but this resolution and taking it to the subcommittee  came out of discussions in Atlanta Friday.\n","Thanks for your consideration,  Steve.?

Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year's anti-arena movement is not seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arena at all. Although this year's opponents lack the nearly $700,000 their higher-profile predecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish their rhetoric. \"Should we spend our city's limited resources on building up rich guys, or do we spend it building up our communities?\" asked activist DeWayne Lark, standing in front of City Hall. \"There will be no more corporate welfare in Harris County.\" Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday's event, which came about three weeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend than for who did. Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year's anti-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former city councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, also supports the new agreement. And although the Harris County Republican Party -- the primary organizer of the 1999 anti-arena effort -- has declined to support the new deal, it has not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped. In the GOP's stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented by Nathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professional sports are critical to a city's identity. Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston's image as a world-class city. \"Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at the drop of a hat,\" she said. And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservative political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major role in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager. Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arena campaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically active family that can raise large amounts of money. Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building sports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get involved in the anti-arena effort. Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the arena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this week to collect contributions. The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 1996 form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to build a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort also opposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extract a better deal from team owners. Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, and certainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal, which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points. Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profile contests. \"We never expected this to be a unanimous vote,\" said Jordan, the co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign, Let's Build it Together. \"Some people will vote against anything.\" \n","FRANCE: Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers.By Stuart Penson\n","10/03/2000Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2000.\n","PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe's power markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure on traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday.

Also, all talk on restructuring is to move forward and not backwards towards re-regulation.  There was also consensus on adopting a national energy policy -- and many speakers linked a national energy policy to national security.\n","Following is a brief summary of comments from various speakers: \n","Senator Voinvich: Supports Congress passing a national energy policy by the end of the year.  His concerns include: need to develop nuclear energy -- said he and Sen. Lander are working on a bill; impact of high energy prices on low income consumers and small businesses b/c we are too reliant on natural gas (did not offer any alternatives to heating w/ gas); the need to harmonize energy and environmental policies (business and environmentalists need to come to the table); very opposed to Sen. Jefford's multi-emissions bill - called it a \"threat to Ohio's economy\" - said he is working with others on a compromise; new source review problem needs to be fixed; and if new ambient air standards go into effect then entire state of OH will be out of compliance.\n","Governor Taft: Announced that he is forming a Federal Energy Policy Group to build consensus in Ohio on promoting the development of wholesale markets that will lead to strong retail markets.  PUCO Chair Schriber will chair this group.  The Governor's staff learned this at the same time the rest of us did.  I have asked Tom Winters to follow through with the governor's office to find out what their plans are.  I told him we likely would be interested in having a spot in the group.

He also announced the Smart Community Challenge Awards for communities that decrease energy use.  Also, October is officially Ohio Energy Month.\n","Senate President Finan: His comments focussed on the state making efforts to promote use of Ohio coal, burning it cleanly and helping companies afford the environmental technologies so they can burn Ohio coal.\n","Speaker Pro Tem Cates:  Did not say much other than a coherent energy policy is absolutely necessary. \n","Consumers Counsel Tongren: Took credit for success of municipal aggregation. Wants to work with federal government on energy policy.  Laid out questions he has for state and national energy policy.  Rob thanked FERC for their work last week on RTOs\n","Allen Hill, CEO of DPL:  Said he was very encouraged by FERCs aggressive agenda and that it is important to get RTOs in place and operational as soon as possible.  He supports a national energy policy.  Says industry needs environmental certainty.  Said SB3 will survive b/c it was based on consensus.  Ohio needs to finish rules on supplier defaults.\n","Jerry Jordan, President, Ind. Petroleum Producers Assocation:  Urged Ohio to stick to the effort of electric restructuring.

I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this.\n","   First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides.  The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.\n","   However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices.\n","   In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.\n","   As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.\n"," Frank\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Let me explainwhy.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talkmore about this.\n","  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricingand specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJMimplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatilityand reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, thePJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deemsis out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The factthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-settingsoftware to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhatunfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that thePJM ISO decides what prices it would likefor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is nota transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buythe risk management services that Enron provides.  Theonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market isthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control areato meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay theimports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.\n","  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on theEast Coast.  This will effectively mean little importsto the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated atthe discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.It effectively kills off the development of risk management atthe wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much lessprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigatedprices.\n","  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternativeform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reducesprice volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they justget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-serviceregulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-servicemitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-serviceprices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.\n","  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sourcesof benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-sideinvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  Anecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflectactual conditions in the market (including the extent of market powerexercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for marketparticipants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJMmodel is just way to have a market in name without achieving anysignificant benefits to consumers or energy traders.\n","Frank\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

On Jan. 1, shares in Enron (news/quote), thegiant energy trading company in Houston, stood at $83.13. On Friday, Enronclosed at $31.57, down 9.7 percent for the week and 62 percent for theyear. The slide has destroyed more than $38 billion in shareholder value.In part, the company's problems are beyond its control, a result of thecollapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a comingglut in electricity. But the deepest wound at Enron is self-inflicted.Heavy insider selling, indecipherable accounting practices and a stream ofexecutive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gapbetween the company and Wall Street.\"The stock is trading under a cloud,\" says James S. Chanos, the presidentof Kynikos Associates, a hedge fund in New York. Mr. Chanos began bettingagainst Enron early this year and says he thinks that the company's sharesremain overvalued.Enron's problems came to a head on Aug. 14, when it announced that JeffreyK. Skilling, the chief executive, had quit for personal reasons.With his resignation, Mr. Skilling joined a half-dozen other top Enronmanagers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities. Still,the news came as a surprise because Mr. Skilling was named to his post onlyin February.Under the best of circumstances, the unexpected departure of a chiefexecutive rattles Wall Street. But hard-headed investors can usuallycomfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearlydeparted pooh-bah has left behind. Executives come and go, but numbers areforever.Unfortunately, Enron's books offer investors little succor. The complexityof the company's businesses and the way it reports its results makeunderstanding Enron's financial statements essentially impossible.Over the last decade, Enron has transformed itself from a simple naturalgas pipeline company into the world's largest trader of electricity andgas. Last year, about three-quarters of the company's cash flow came out ofthe company's wholesale services division, which includes its tradingoperations.But Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes. Are theyshort-term or long-term? Is the company hedged, or does it make\"directional bets\" on the prices of the commodities it trades?The answers are crucial, because they determine how much risk Enron hastaken to make its money. Big profits are nice. Big profits that come frombig, risky trades are a recipe for big, unexpected write-offs.Enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closelyrelated companies in \"related party\" transactions. The company says thatthe deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and thatthey have been approved by its board and outside auditors.But related-party deals can provide a convenient way for public companiesto shift losses to private affiliates. And Enron's disclosure about itsrelated-party deals, including billions of dollars in asset swaps with apartnership that until recently was controlled by the company's chieffinancial officer, is notably sketchy.In the good old days, like last year, companies could get away with theunlikeliest of accounting gimmicks, as long as their revenue and profitnumbers looked good. But Wall Street has become more demanding, as Enron islearning to its chagrin.Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, says the company is aware of investors'concerns. \"We've got credibility issues on the street, no question,\" Mr.Palmer says. \"We're looking at a lot of ways to give our investors moreinformation.\"Sooner would be better than later.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Here's why:                      - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule                        on market-based rate eligibility.                    - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very                       high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up                    reasons.  I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we                     know they don't care about.  I think the real reason                     is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the                     new rule comes out.                      - -  No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable                     to get kicked out, too.  They might not want to give                     MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new                     rule.                     - -    The best way to deal with that is to sit down with                      staff, go over the draft page by page, and see                     what more they want.  But that would take too long,                     because of staff's schedule.                     - -   The second best way is for me to call Dan                     Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that                     we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a                    deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft                    about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if                     that's good enough.  If he suggests different                     language, we'll have to put it in there.                     - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this                     through without saying anything to FERC in                     advance, we can file it, and just hope that the                     language we have about complying with the new                     rule  is good enough.   But that's really not what I                     would recommend. \n","         If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today.  If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. \n","             2.

We then met up with GM on the Friday.\n","Basically GM Petroleos (the main GM company) has entered into the Spanish equivalent of U.S. Ch.11. We have still not seen a copy of the petition presented to the Court, but this shd be forthcoming in the next day or so. The idea behind the petition for suspension of payments is to help companies that are facing liquidity problems. GM wd certainly fit that bill, although it remains doubtful as to whether GM can claim that its assets exceed its liabilities. The effect of the petition is to provide a moratorium on the repayment of any unsecured creditors, and on any judgments which those creditors obtain. The petition does not however prevent any preferred or secured creditors from enforcing their debts (in the latter case, to the extent of their security). \n","The judge to whom the petition is presented appoints 3 administrators. 2 are appointed from a list of accountants that the court maintains, and the third (also appointed by the court) is a representative of one of the top third of the list of creditors.\n","Once the administrators are appointed, the financial control of GMP will be their responsibility. They will authorize any future transactions, draw up the definitive list of creditors, and examine the solvency or otherwise of the company. In due course they will submit a report to the judge advising as to whether the company is insolvent or not. If insolvent, the Court will request that GMP provide a warranty for the difference between the amount owed and the assets. If this is not met within 14 days, subsidiary proceedings may be started to examine any personal liability of the management. \n","Parallel with this, the administrators will be speaking to all the creditors with a view to reaching an inter creditor arrangement on repayment of an agreed level of debt. Even though secured creditors are not precluded in enforcing their security during the suspension of payments procedure, it is usual for them too to take part in these discussions.\n","The outside lawyers seemed to think that the amount contained in the petition is equivalent to USD 85 million. We have no real idea how this is broken down, but the following shd be a rough guide:\n","VAT authority - USD 25 millionVeba - USD 15 millionEnron - USD 5 millionTotal - USD 3millionBank debt - USD 22 million - balance USD15 million\n","The Spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure may be difficult to prove as a debt. This exposure arises from the market difference we agreed to sell Dec. shipments to GMP (which then cd not put up the agreed purchase price to ensure delivery) and the current market price. Chris can confirm what these losses are today. We wd have to sue on those agreements (English arbitration), and then present to the administrators the arbitration judgments. However, as the administrators report is usually ready within 2-3months, I suspect that leaving aside any other factors there may be a timing problem here. \n","The Spanish lawyers said that GMP Board may have some personal liability issues. The Board is supposed to call a shareholders meeting if the company is in financial difficulties. Moreover, if there has been stripping out of assets from GMP, then those responsible may face criminal sanction\n","On the issue of preferences, it wd appear that Spanish law is somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand there is old jurisprudence to the effect that any and all transactions entered into by the debtor before its insolvency can be challenged by the administrators, irrespective of whether those transactions wd constitute a preference. On the other hand there is jurisprudence of equivalent weight which states that this is not the case, and that only preferences may be challenged. The Spanish lawyers were not able to say which system wd apply in the current scenario, but their insolvency lawyer made the following points:\n","there was no immediate threat from anyone against Enron or ECTRIC Spain. The whole issue about preferences is not dealt with until the report by the administrators is made to the judge. There is no chance of any nasty shocks like injunctions on Arcos etc.the payment to Enron of USD50 million at the same time as the VAT authorities were not being paid shd not overly worry Enron at the moment, as such payments are unlikely to be seen as a preference.most companies (even those judged insolvent) end up being dissolved voluntarily, probably as a result of the uncertainty of Spanish insolvency law. If a voluntary arrangement is reached it is unlikely to provide for anything but the most obvious preference (and the transfer of the strategic oil from GM to ECTRIC Spain wd not fall within this category)The VAT authorities (probably the main creditor) are not pro active in these sorts of proceedings and tend to take a back seat   \n","For what t is worth, GM made the following points:\n","GM's banks' inability to fund further prompted GMP management to make the petition (this despite the fact that GM had previously assured Enron that the GMP bank debt was minimal)petition is for Pta 10 billionGM lawyer said shd have made decision earlier to present the petitionGM lawyer also said that GMP had made what he called \"third party financing\" of Pta 6 billion, and accepted my suggestion that the administrators wd be asking for such funds back GMP wd be willing to put up Don Antonio's assets to secure Enron's continuing supplies to it (we have heard that many times before). Without such supplies GM stated that GMP was insolvent. They were not able to provide a reason as to why such assets cd not be pledged beforehandGMP sees Enron as the \"key\", namely that the supplies if resumed wd trigger the payment to GM of its outstanding receivables.  GM wants Enron to meet with the administrators next week.\n","It is early days but I wd suggest the following:\n","unlikely the old man's assets will be forthcominglikley the company will go into insolvencylikley the creditors will reach a voluntary arrangementtherefore unlikely there will be any clawback of earlier payments/strategic storage oilequally, unlikely Enron will receive any recognition of its MTM debt \n","Chris, let me know if there is anything you wd like to add/clarify. otherwise once we get the petition we will advise further. tks\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

The details are :-\n","     Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB % Increase\n","Gas Export (including surcharges)  $0.18  $0.2205  22.5%  $0.26 (excluding RG)  44.4%Liquids Domestic    $1.05  $2.46  134.3%  $3.25    209.5%Liquids Export     $1.55  $2.31  49%  $3.35    116.1%\n","CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19  $2.20  84.9%  $3.528    196.5%\n","As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our liquids domestic) !!\n","We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :-\n","1. Export gas volumes increased to 100% TR capacity, and 100% GSA + Cuiaba 2 assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes2. RG Compresion project deleted3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions7. OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004.8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30\n","Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :-\n","1. Volumes.  Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back here.  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term i.e. 2002/2003.2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the support of BG3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff  revision and actual rates are used.  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited.4. Liquids Expansion in the South.  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production will be shut in.  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco).  We will then write to those producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE.  We will give them an estimate of the lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from this decision.  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal.5. Continuity of Service Capex.  We need to see the detail here.  We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards.  We need to see exactly what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision.  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process.6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday.7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy.8. Debt/Equity ratio.  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 40%.  However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 100% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 60/40.  We intend to fight this one very hard using all the external/independant help we can get.\n","As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut.  This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases.  Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases.\n","Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions (i.e. the worst case).\n","Regards,Doug\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected.  It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \"fault\" for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points.  Whoever is blamed might not really matter.  My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West.  This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets.  Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets.

Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken recently.

I suspect that govt. affairs needs tojustify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefitsof the function are important to quantify.

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money.

But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis.

Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $1.3 million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis. In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they did receive raises. Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers.

Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again. A resolution passed 48-7 asked President George W. Bush, Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restore the regulation of natural gas that ended in 1992. Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years. We're not seeing adequate action from the federal government,\" said the author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Atwater. Republicans refused to vote for the resolution, complaining that it was an attack on the GOP Bush administration. Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E. Frank received $760,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $1.35 million last year. And Edison Mission Energy CEO Alan J. Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand. The council voted 3-2 Wednesday to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy plants in the city.

Mr. Klayman remains hopeful. \"We're confident any judge who sees this will have to release the documents,\" he said.A similar but separate case, brought by several newspapers, will be heard May 18 in a San Diego Superior Court. \"This is a huge financial burden on the taxpayers without an opportunity for the taxpayers to scrutinize the terms,\" Hal Fuson, chairman of the government affairs committee of the California Newspaper Publishers Association, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \"The general climate surrounding the governor's approach to this has been one of secrecy.\"The governor's position is that releasing the details now could make it harder for the state to get the best prices for electricity.

Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power\n","SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -\n","FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and\n","Electric Company\n","There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effectPacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had onenergy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few usefulfacts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may bedriving the state's energy costs higher.\n","Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was payingroughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct resultof the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, evenlaudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsidesof utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governorshould know better.\n","Consider the facts:\n","--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest\n","investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to\n","below investment grade by every major rating agency.\n","Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to\n","sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.\n","--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state\n","Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power\n","purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the\n","Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an\n","ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could\n","be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in\n","the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the\n","full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional\n","generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or\n","have under contract, to meet customer demand.\n","However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of\n","state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full\n","net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know\n","for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say\n","how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will\n","the ISO.)\n","--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n","informed the Independent System Operator that it could not\n","force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,\n","both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

I have asked John to lead the effort, to the extent you need him.  John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office.  Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question.  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs.  A little background I'll bore you with:  after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups.

We are using several parts of your team, and are very pleased with most. I want to mention a couple of areas, HR and Security.\n","1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20 hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR, and Drew had his team there for us.\n","2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team on the ground, and John has provided leadership and all coordination with Houston. Great efforts and productive work.\n","3. Security: This area has not worked as well, and if you ever want feedback on our one-time experience with this group, I will provide it. I don't have any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night, and Mike has informed us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate with that person.\n","On a side note, the people who have really been helpful were brought in through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he would come.\n","At Mike's earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill & Associates to help on security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates, removing (in a lowkey yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from servers, desktops and laptops.

EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any \"headroom\" for REC purchases.Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in order for the \"greening\" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.  HOWEVER, it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.  I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some of the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs cost).  We will then need to decide the following: a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for the RECs; b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs; c.

Some times, even if no new information is provided, people simply feel better because an effort is made to communicate with them.  People appreciated your open-ness and the frank-ness with which you addressed some of the tougher questions regarding long term employment viability or security.  On the other hand, people read a message into the statements regarding the fact that retention packages will be developed for key individuals.  They read that if they didn't get a retention package they should be looking for a job because they are not key.  Perhaps, bluntly, that is exactly what the message is but now you have many people spending their time trying to figure out the \"definition of key individual.\"  People like to feel important (non-core is, for them, non-important) and absent that they worry about every little thing - many of these no one can help or mitigate.  Finally, people took comfort in the comment regarding how long it might take for all to be sold (i.e,. approx. 3 years) and understood and felt better that no fire sale will take place.    \n","My biggest recommendations are:- We need to keep up our communication efforts; people feel important and feel better if folks make an effort to communicate;  Pete and I (and others) need to work on  communicating further with each of our teams and on motivating them to support the company during these tough times but both you and Jim should continue to  update people as often as possible.- We need to move quickly to identify our key people so that we can be effective about retention efforts;  my own view is that you start with the field; those are your  most critical individuals because they are running the asset.  - We need to continue to deliver the message that the merger is a good thing and that it is not simply another \"life\" bought out by Enron (i.e., many people felt and still  feel that there is still a chance Enron might make on its own and would pay the breakage fee to get out of the Dynegy deal - this may be more hope than belief but  that is the case).\n","A key distinction that I noted in the meeting today was that it sounds as though we will move forward very aggressively to sell all of the EGAS assets.  There is no longer the attitude or position that: if the asset has good earnings and good cashflow, then what's the hurry.  The message today (and forgive me if I mis-read it) was: we will put together a corp. development group that will be focused on selling EGAS assets even if they are performing assets - cash is still king and will continue to be until the merger.\n","Hope this helps and THANK YOU very much for taking the time to talk to us.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on the company's liquidity position.  \n","Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.\n","This is simply an overall \"guidance\" question.

The amendment does not surprise me though. \n"," In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in '91, we developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included--the thinking by the various State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones, funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately unearthed.  It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and consultation process....not only when objects were unearthed, but simply putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to construction.  (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans together..Haha!!)   As I said, I've not read the amendment , but hopefully it only legally requires 'notice'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing law, I've rarely seen  a 'notice' that didn't crack the door or sound the alarm of further buerocratic opportunity!\n","For your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and he's a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ; yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to 'perceived economic opportunity'.   Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match, and is proud of it!! --which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes you--he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and \"plays\"in whatever stage opportunity is presented him--as long as he can be the center of attention.  The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has his own!!  Check it out--it's a hoot!!  He has been chief for about 25 years (and I'm guessing he's maybe in his early 50's).  The Seminoles have recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely a \"My way or the highway\" kind of guy--he loves you, hates you, or ignores you--and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn't like, he'll know no limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!! No Joke!\n","I don't recognize the other names on the list, but I think it's clear from both the beurocratic issues, as well as the specific tribal issues incident to each affected tribe, everything associated with the process should be executed with all of this in mind.

Below is a short excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning Enron:\n","\"Proponents of renewable power viewed California's deregulation as flawed from the onset three years ago. Still, they anticipated that with adequate publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the traditional power supply, which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil fuels and nuclear power, and that the demand would spur supply. The number of producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow -- as long as the big utilities didn't interfere.\n","That's what almost happened. Over the last three years, retailers like Green Mountain Energy and Utility.com bought green power already available in California and started to invest in building their own renewable energy generators, like windmill farms and large solar-panel assemblies. Still, for all the optimism and effort, only about 200,000 customers -- less than 1 percent of the 8.5 million households that had the option of switching providers -- chose to support them. Many of those were swayed by a deregulation-mandated credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who switched. When natural gas prices were high, the credit actually represented a real savings. Historically, environmentally conscious consumers have paid a penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, along with an average monthly surcharge of $5.\n","Then, last fall, the fledgling industry started to crumble. Energy wholesalers like Enron (NYSE: ENE) and Calpine (NYSE: CPN) responded to a rising demand for energy by raising their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt hour to as much as $1.50. Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy power. Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a price that was less than their cost. When the energy crisis hit, many green consumers' bills more than doubled.\"\n","In light of the recent e-mail that was sent out, I thought that I would bring this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that Enron does not raise prices, it transacts in a market where prices are set by supply and demand.  The average person reading this could very easily come to the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy companies, which is clearly not the case.  Nonetheless, thought you might find this of interest.\n","Chris HilgertEnron AmericasEnron Compression Services\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.\"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,\" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. \"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of this,\" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government relations. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. \"We'll be circulating them very broadly,\" Mr. Rice said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. \"That makes it a much more serious issue,\" Mr. Rice said. \"We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.\" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. \"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,\" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate Beneficiaries\n","Top 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance forfiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millions\n","Boeing $3,335Bechtel Group $1,075Distributed Processing Systems $388Willbros Group $387United Technologies $334Raytheon $156General Electric $150Halliburton $136Enron $135LSI Logic $120\n","Source: Ex-Im Bank\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. \n","Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish ReformsBy Germana CanziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n","03/07/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n","LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.com\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\n","LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, \"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later.\" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. \"Trust me,\" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. \"There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare.\" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion.\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report.A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. \"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,\" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently. Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and South, respectively. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 07/03/01 01-04G\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. \"This is not a done deal,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. \"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. -- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.Some storage buying occurred in Texas \"if they could make it work,\" a trader said. \"It was a pretty uneventful day,\" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather. Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer.

Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.\"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,\" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. \"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of this,\" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government relations. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. \"We'll be circulating them very broadly,\" Mr. Rice said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. \"That makes it a much more serious issue,\" Mr. Rice said. \"We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.\" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. \"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,\" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate Beneficiaries\n","Top 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance forfiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millions\n","Boeing $3,335Bechtel Group $1,075Distributed Processing Systems $388Willbros Group $387United Technologies $334Raytheon $156General Electric $150Halliburton $136Enron $135LSI Logic $120\n","Source: Ex-Im Bank\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. \n","Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish ReformsBy Germana CanziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n","03/07/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n","LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.com\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\n","LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, \"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later.\" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. \"Trust me,\" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. \"There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare.\" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion.\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report.A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. \"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,\" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently.

Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. \"This is not a done deal,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. \"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. -- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.Some storage buying occurred in Texas \"if they could make it work,\" a trader said. \"It was a pretty uneventful day,\" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather. Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu. -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As follows:\n","Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.\n","1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.\n","Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

I am currently a Development Support Manager with EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I  had the good fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.  He represents a company called IdleAire Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also, these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.\n","IdleAire's  goal is to: \n","\"........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television.\"\n","Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, D.C.  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.  \n","I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do.  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and the capital to invest in this project.  \n","Enron would benefit in several ways:\n","1.  Greater than average returns.\n","2.  Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.  (EPA Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....)\n","3.  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.\n","4.  Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.\n","5.  Open a whole new market for the energy services group. (EES)  Long term maintenance contract, commodities, etc....\n","6.  Open a new market for the broadband services group. (EBS)  Videos on demand.\n","I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.  If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce him to you.  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an executive summary of the business.

Monday was a holiday!Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with lastminute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills.\n","-- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee.  Thismeasure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilityas a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction.  The bill alsoplaces the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages forgeneration units.  Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onlyintention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages,but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manneroutlined in the bill.  IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end alongwith CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the CaliforniaCogeneration Council.  The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill.Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to theopposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen.  The message fromthe opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as itpassed out of the committee on a party-line vote.  IEP is currentlyreassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not theonly bill that proposes similar changes.\n","-- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne,was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills.  The first was AB 34x (LaSuer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includingsome IEP-sponsored language.  IEP has a support if amended position on thebill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable.  Lastminute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone ahearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26).  However, because the Keeleyamendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill,La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committeeanalysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its currentform.\n","AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committeewith only one =01&no=018 vote.  AB 36x would provide expedited siting for arepower project, as defined.  However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the billamended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects.  Theauthor has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental communityand the CEC to develop language that works for everyone.  IEP=01,s major issueat this point is that is should actually work.  The measure was doublereferred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will beheard there next.\n","-- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x(Battin).  All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for themeasure.  IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizingmembers on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure inthe Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing.  Both SCEand WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will beopposing the bill.\n","-- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financingauthority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed tothe Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next. IEP met withSenator Burton=01,s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relatingto limiting the Authority=01,s eminent domain powers.  Staff was open to whatwe had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will moveforward with the bill.  Regardless, IEP will continue to push for amendmentson the Assembly side.\n","-- SB 33x (Burton), which would require the Governor=01,s plan to purchase theIOU=01,s transmission to be approved first by the Legislature, is stillawaiting consideration on the Senate floor.\n","-- The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status onthe negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchaseof the utilities=01, transmission system.  Reuters is saying there the Governorhas a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for $2.76billion.  Negotiations are still going on with PG&E and SDG&E.

They can submit the whole or a small part of the organisation.Pilot companies pay for the verifiers' time only and the verifiers aregiving their time at cost ($750/ day.) The pilot itself will take the formof a preliminary scoping meeting in which the verifier will take the companythrough the evidence (policies and procedures) that need to be in place inorder to pass the GoodCorporation charter. The meeting will decide who needsto be interviewed, in which locations and therefore the number of daysinvolved. As the emphasis is on verifying policies and the way they areimplemented in the workplace rather than a full scale audit of impact, thenumber of days involved should be relatively limited.  During the actualverification, the verifier will check for the evidence by reviewingdocumentation provided by the company, in addition to a series of meetingswith the relevant people, such as the HR Director, Environmental Manager,Finance Directors and customer-facing staff. Assuming it is successful, thepiloted part of the company can then become a member of the network if theyso choose. \n","It would be great to have Enron involved in this early piloting.

Gen. Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houston-based power company  should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous, tattooed inmate named  Spike.       Lockyer, who is investigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity  market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that  appeared Tuesday.       \"I would love to  personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell  that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike,  honey,' \" Lockyer said.       Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment \"counterproductive rhetoric\" that \"does not  merit a response.\"       But other industry  representatives denounced the remark as \"outrageous,\" especially because  neither Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against Enron or other companies.       \"You'd  expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges first and  make public statements second,\" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and traders. \"We're very  disappointed with his choice of words, which don't exactly fit the profile  of his office.\"       In an interview Tuesday,  Lockyer said he decided to \"ratchet up\" the commentary to \"put [energy  companies] on notice\" that \"we are not afraid of them and have the will to  prosecute.\"       \"What I'm trying to do is  let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them, they're  going to be prosecuted,\" Lockyer said. \"Just because they're  multimillionaires and run big corporations, it doesn't provide them with  immunity.\"       The attorney general is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market.  Several panels, including a state Senate committee and the California  Public Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes.        On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators. The attorney general went to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand  them over.       Lockyer said the forthcoming  documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws.       \"Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity,\" Lockyer said. \"But we need to make  sure it's compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury.\"        Lockyer said he singled out Enron's  chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader.        At least one observer found Lockyer's  comments refreshingly candid. Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers  Union, said, \"Let Lockyer be Lockyer.\"  * * *      Times staff writer Dan  Morain contributed to this story.

The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now.  We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,  and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.  We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together.  Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.  This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance.  We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress.  A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me).  I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask.

Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.\n","These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.\n","I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.

(EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were a rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston.  Attached is a memo we handed out to employees, but basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.   3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process.   a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer.\n","I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.

(EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were a rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston.  Attached is a memo we handed out to employees, but basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.   3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process.   a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer.\n","I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).

I would suggest talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.\n","This afternoon I notified our partners and thr Gov't of India of our intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two weeks.

Their message was simple (and simplistic):\n","El Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.\n","Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.

While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must maintain a neutral and independent posture.  This is sometimes a difficult path to navigate, but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron:1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies.  We are considering how best to broadcast our assessment, without impinging on our core business, or becoming an expert witness.  We think a workshop, similar to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work, where we would present our findings and issue a report.2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West - especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy.  This would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or university.  Again the reults would go to our clients, but could be released to a wider audience, and a workshop might help highlight the release.Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron.

I realize that there is some concern that Wanda is a litigation threat, so for the purposes of soliciting legal advice and in anticipation of litigation, I am forwarding my recollection of today's meeting to you:\n","Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as \"unfair and discriminatory\" treatment.  When I asked her what she meant specifically (and did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she did not intend the legal meaning of those terms;  rather, she, on  a \"personal\" level,  felt that the company should have treated her better.  She mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron, that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory (because Sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the company.I described several options for her:Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization;Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick again)Take severence under the standard package;Take severence as a \"business reorg\" but consult with Enron for a period.At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't particularly happy about any of the  alternatives), but at the end of the discussion expressed interest in the second option.A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints about how she had been treated.  Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about job assignments.  I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some insensitivity.  I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated her unfairly.Wanda did complain about many things, but never once complained about her pay at Enron.\n","Mary, these are my recollections from today.

Comments welcome\n","\"The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy.   His decision was based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form.  \n","\"I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative \"anti-environment\" reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations.  Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts of action regulate CO2 emissions.\"\n","\"The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market.  We are well-positioned through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management.\"\n","\"A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint.  Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way.  If we're able to make meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx, SO2 and mercury -- and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on CO2 whether it is regulated or not.\"\n","In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy and environmental problems.\n","----- Forwarded by Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron on 03/22/2001 05:55 PM -----\n","\tRosalee Fleming\t03/22/2001 11:16 AM\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:\n","I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would be appreciated.As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to \"wallpaper\" Sacramento with our proposed legislation.This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the \"final\" versions of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver to his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom you've decided to circulate.This email does, however, include a \"summary\" of our proposed legislation.  But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute \"to the world,\" or if we'll need instead to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a \"one pager\" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively.We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team could propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition?We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.  You note that attached to the email is a \"legislative fix\" to AB1X that could solve the credit issue and an attached set of \"taking points\" related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying that DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section (legislative solution) under the topic \"create a real competitive retail market in California.\"  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.\n","If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n","Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n","Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit the elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development of distributed generation. Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investor-owned and municipal utilities\n","Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from the utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n","Permitting and Air Quality IssuesDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission and therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale generation faces.  \n","Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facilities. In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects.  These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n","3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities \n","Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers.Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s credit risk concerns.Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward.\n","Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n","Ambiguous Ratemaking AuthorityThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n","Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then refuse to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers. Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power PurchasesIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to employ to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it is extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensure DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it is difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n","Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk \n","We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit risk issues.  We have identified three options:\n","Amend AB1XThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incurred by DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n","Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and through Contract LanguageThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly more time to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled, =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n","Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit RiskAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to accept other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit, cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through contract amendments.\n","4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n","Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They differ only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  All credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are likely.  \n","CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operation in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced to date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess the flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply.  California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement.  \n","Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's severe supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the current pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n","CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California should view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n","5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=01,s Electricity Crisis\n","This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We will deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n","As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's crisis must focus on four issues:\n","Increase supplyDecrease demandEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity marketReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n","Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years.  Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n","The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legislation are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve those efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2) transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected air districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions.\n","Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished most effectively and quickly in two ways:\n","Buy-down demandCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fund to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g., through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&Deal Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n","Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary CurtailmentTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n","An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price for hour-ahead power in real time. Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification.Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n","The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include:\n","=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, particularly in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation resources.reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state.fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding. \n","We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 times that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n","Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehicle: SB27XThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego were customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove the prohibition against Direct Access.\n","Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department of Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration.  \n","In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procurement is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load.\n","Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative vehicle: AB18XUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand.  In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extended period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to participate in that market.\n","California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without =01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California could amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year period.  In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways: First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB 1890.

There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues.  One of them exludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, specifically including connection fees.  In the example in the e-mail, the issue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that are then transferred to the utility.  Will check on that angle.\n","In any event, Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdiction of Barton's subcommittee.

ERCOT will present its agreement and procedures and EPSA will present a list of problems that members have had.  Enron worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs.  EEI will also make a presentation.  (Additionally, as you are probably aware, over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotline and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconnection issues -- this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issues.)\n","At the end of the Nov. 1 meeting, other meeting participants will have a brief amount of time to raise issues.  Donna Fulton will attend for Enron.  FERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interconnection procedures and parts of an IA (results due to FERC Dec 14).  We will then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec. 21.  \n","FERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings; therefore, it will most likely not be dealing with the tax gross-up and crediting issues yet.  It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rulemaking.  (We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most problematic part of interconnection negotiations, but this is the way FERC wants to proceed.  FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders when disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecuted.)\n","By way of background on ERCOT, as I understand it, ERCOT basically rolls in the interconnection costs (network-type upgrades) to the entire grid through TCOS (an uplift).  However, TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited -- ERCOT has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the best interest of the grid.  Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT to this method.  We will need to formulate Enron's view in the next phase of the interconnection proceeding.\n","For Thurs. meeting, I think Donna should raise these issues:-- While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminate the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and over, the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business circumstances (for example, the notice to proceed that we have been including.)\n","-- While having timelines and procedures are fine, the larger problem has been getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures (for example, Entergy was one of the first to file procedures, yet seems to have a problem sticking to their timelines.)  This yet again means that RTOs are critical to stop the discriminatory practices and to provide incentives to treat us as customers.\n","--There needs to be more discussion on best practice No.2 below -- Energy resource or capacity resource.  This should be reviewed in the context of FERC's NOPR on icap (Enron just submitted comments that \"capacity\" as a separate payment is not necessary in functioning markets.  In addition, \"capacity\" is not a separately required \"payment\" in most parts of the US outside of current ISOs (ERCOT does not have icap)).\n","Attached is the ANOPR, ERCOT IA and procedures.  Susan Lindberg will be circulating a draft of Enron comments on the agreement and procedures.  Included on p. 11 of the ANOPR are \"best practices\" which include:\n","1. Comparable treatment for IPPs (allowed to be competing network resources for load without having to be designated as a \"network\" resouce)2. Multiple interconnection products:  Energy resource and capacity resource3. Small generator exemption4. Queueing with reasonable milestones (10 days to correct deficiencies)5. Deposits (with deposits over actual cost refunded)6. Siting: TPs would post optimal and non-optimal sites for locating generators (this is something that we had asked some new ITCs to provide.

Although I did not see the word \"congestion\", the implication of what I read is that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion impacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in \"but for\" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude.  Did I?\n","I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgotten about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this upgrade and \"but for\" stuff, and then \"gives\" it to the utility, are there taxes due on the \"gift\"?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the taxes on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned over to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to \"waste\" on an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dept (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was considering.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection to address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC process?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process?  \n","I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents to the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, \"all generators are good and benefit the ratepayers.\")  On fundamental grounds they will resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the insult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades), they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine strongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it.  And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problems around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considering adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the grid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Because all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we supported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now developing in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system upgrades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the \"gift\" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmission system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nice if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of dealing with the tax issues in this NOPR?\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning.\n","HP contacts to date: \n","Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales ManagerHouston, TX#(713)-439-5587(Gerry Cashiola's boss)\n","Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX#(713)-439-5555(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)\n","Greg Pyle, Solution Control ManagerSoutheast RegionAustin, TX (#(512)-257-5735(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)\n","Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliancesAustin, TX#(512)-257-5736(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)\n","Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services SolutionsCupertino, CA#(408)-447-5240(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting)\n","Matt,\n","On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).\n","On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:\n","1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?\n","2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)\n","3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   \n","In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:\n","Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.\n","Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central Region.\n"," In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points:  \n"," a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)\n"," b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron\n"," Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person.  \n","We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities. \n","Sarah-Joy HunterEnron CorporationGlobal Strategic Sourcing - Business Development#(713)-345-6541\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .\n","  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that  commodity price.\n","  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.\n","  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to  schools and hospitals.\n","  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.\n","  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the  rate-cap measure is \"deeply flawed\" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or  December 2003.\n","  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through  December 2002. \"It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,\" he said because it \"creates  tremendous uncertainty\" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance  new projects such as a new transmission line.\n","  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that  review the plans. \n","  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, 10/4/00). Such discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the lawsuit said. \n","The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. \n","Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. \n","\"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the lawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. \n","The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 percent are women. \n","Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. \n","The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft. \n","\"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are \"systemic in nature, and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's operations,\" the lawsuit maintains. \n","'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged\n","The complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them.\"\n","The lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation system\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\" Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. \n","\"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee with a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to resign, the complaint said. \n","\"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. \n","\"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal popularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working for different managers. \n","In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries \"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit said. \n","Furthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees. \n","By Nan Netherton\n","Copyright , 2000 by The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., Washington D.C.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:\n","1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).\n","Below is a summary of the entire settlement:\n","1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.\n","Below for your information is the plan.\n","At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.

This approach maximizes the utilization of the existing infrastructure (reduces idle or redundant facilities) and gives customers the ability to more closely tailor their energy purchases to the their needs.\n","There are barriers to achieve this vision. It is in the interest of the governments to work in a common protocol to progress rapidly.\n","Development of infrastructure .- Still not well developed. Needs to attract project financing. At this stage, the customers have few alternatives. Government policy should be to allow access above and beyond what was initially contracted to justify the financing. Terms of financing have to be honored. Long term, competing facilities (pipelines, refineries, transmission lines, power plants) will be fighting for customers.\n","Threat. Control of these facilities: Petrobras through the BBPL; YPF in Argentina \n","Cross-border Licensing.- Very time consuming, bureaucratic delays to grant, export, import, re-export permitting.  Present regime cannot accommodate  the rapid transaction scenario which will be required to support real integration.\n","Cuiaba Power plant,- As of today we have not received all the permits. Latest issue is the Bolivian-Argentina border dispute due to YPF denial to accommodate a transaction of Bolivian gas into Argentina.\n","Operationally, the plant will receive daily instructions from Brasilia. The gas supply from Argentina/Bolivia, including spot market transaction  has to be nominated within 48 hours notice.  There are no mechanisms to change quickly the approved volumes.\n","Commercial entities need to be given the opportunity to export/import to aggregate the requirements of different suppliers various customers.\n","Taxation.- Transfer taxes (i.e. receipt taxes ,stamp taxes) for each step down the chain needs to be eliminated for commercial entities, particularly for export transactions.\n","These commercial entities buy pieces of the services on behalf of the ultimate customer (act as their agent) and package the final offer. The objective to  reduce the cost of the product, which would not be met by adding a further taxable event. There should not be  more, nor any less taxes because of the services of the middle company, except for the larger amount of income taxes generated by increase commercial activity.\n","Money Transfers.-  Central Bank Controls to authorize the transfer of currency needs to be made more agile. Currently these procedures are very time consuming and cumbersome (Brazil -- I am not as familiar with the other countries)\n","This is affecting us in Cuiaba. The Central Bank has not approved the gas contract, specifically the Take-or-pay provision that has a one-year make up period. They want a longer make-up period, but that was negotiated with YPF as part of the larger agreement. YPF may agree but at a higher price.

The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a matter of changing the law, changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the gas to flow on it's section of pipe which I understand is not under the jurisdiction of Enargas. What can the government do?\n","JB.- I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation, how these pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator.  If it is determined that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network, in time a bypass pipeline may be built.

On Monday we have meetings with the Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy and Mines.  What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private?  Myself in public? or the Minister of External Affairs?\n","JB.- For background, the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising dollarization of their economy, \"desnacionaliza?ao\". Their concern is not the US$, it is control. It is that the Old-boys network in Brazil Government/Industry, has been disturbed by the New-boys taking control of high visibility sectors, Banking, telecommunications, energy.  \n","Malan, Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be active in direct investment and support of big projects.Complaints about BNDES (Brazilian development bank) lending to foreigners for privatization (Recent AES incident)Tourinho, Mines and Energy-- pushing a new privatization model -- sale of stock at the market, not sale of control to a given company.

Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas. There cannot be true competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants, price setters, gas power plants.\n","As a note, there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of 51% control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline.

Covas is very influential. His current battle deals with tax reforms in Brazil. He is fighting a system of tax-preferences in other states to attract industries, which ultimately creates a Federal burden and consequently a Sao Paulo burden.\n","The Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance.\n","I assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time. \n","JB.- There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them.

Since I am on vacation (or at least trying to be) I didn't go back into the office looking for you later in the day.  The following are my last thoughts regarding Government and Reg Affairs people and organisational issues.  I will leave them with you and the others do with as you like.  John T.\n","0)\tBackground:  Cross-border issues in power and EU vs. the Germans and Dutch in Gas will likely be the big issues in the\tnext 12 to 18 months on the continent.  We have the potential to add as much value via GovRegAffairs activity on the\tcontinent in the next 12 months as through any commercial activity.  Much of this activity will have to be EU focused.  In\tpower especially we have gotten almost - not quite all - but almost all that we can hope to get exclusively from national \tlevel work.  (Italy and Spain are of course big exceptions.)  Gas is and always has been much more of a Europe-wide\ttheme than a national theme.  We will have to carefully manage our public GRA message and approach to take tough\tpositions without creating unneeded enemies.  We should look for local national allies where possible.  We cannot be the\t\tonly voice in any country supporting a major position.  If there are no local forces supporting the position, we need to\tfind/create some allies.  It cannot be Enron vs. Germany; or, even worse, Enron and EU vs Germany (or Switzerland, or\twherever).  Loss of momentum at this time would be an error; however, focus would be an accomplishment.  Each issue\twill need a simultaneous AND co-ordinated EU and local effort. \n","1)\tStyles and the EU Office:  I am convinced that Peter Styles is the most important single continent based GRA asset at\tthis time and for the next 18 to 24 months.  Everyone including me has their own stories about Peter - not all positive.\tBut he is the right man, at the right time at the right place.  Within the bounds of what is managerially and financially\tresponsible, it is important to keep the Styles-force working for Enron at the EU level.  Beyond his linguistic skills he\tunderstands absolutely what Enron needs to make money on the continent.  Of course, we should begin thinking about\tPeter's EVENTUAL retirement.  We should never allow anyone to be permanently as essential as Peter has become.\tBUT, right now he is essential.\n","2)\tGerman GRA Activities:  Permanent resource (100%) should become Jan Haizmann (or however you spell it).  He is\tabrupt and offensive to Anglo-Saxons - but then, he is very German - and the directness that some of us have come to\tappreciate about the Germans is often mistaken as rudeness by those who have not worked with them much.  I have gotten\tconsistently positive feed-back from senior German colleagues especially about his performance with senior German\tofficials such as the head of the Federal Cartel Office.  My understanding is that Haizmann wants to move to Frankfurt.  If\tthis is true, I would encourage it.  There are no German official offices (other than the Embassy) in London.\n","\tWe have, I believe, all agreed that Paul Hennemeyer is more of a self-propelled project guy than a team player.  Thus, I \twould agree that probably mid- to long-term he should move on within Enron to other Hennemeyer sized projects.  But,\tin the immediate future, he has several very important projects going on in German speaking Europe.  Additionally, with\ta new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up, with renewed interest in Austria and with the \tnecessity to engage somewhat in Switzerland (regarding transit), it does not look to me like we should let Paul leave too\tquickly.  As a somewhat mentor to Haizmann, passing off relationships in an orderly manner, ensuring that projects do not\tfall through the cracks, etc. there is still much for Paul to do. It will be, however, necessary to give him a clear picture of\this future or Enron will lose him entirely.  An open ended \"project boy\" job will not keep Paul indefinitely.  Let's not lose\tPaul to Enron even if we have to slowly move him out of Europe.\n","3)\tLars Atenhoefer:  Lars is much in demand by Gregor and others for his unique brand of consulting based commercial work.\tI continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than 50% GRA front-end for Switzerland.  He would be glad to\tdo that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus.  Switzerland does not/will not justify full-time GRA\tsupport; but, we must get more engaged there.  Less for our Swiss business than for our cross-border business and for\tcontinued grid and water power access.  The liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held. Everything going on in\tSwitzerland now by real players is based on the failure of that vote. Important to work with Gregor and Eric to ensure that\tLars continues to see a variety of opportunities in Enron.  His academic and professional preparation is perfect for a GRA\tperson.  He belongs to Gregor and Eric.  I recommend talking with them about him.\n","4)\tDoug Wood:  I do not see a mid- or long-term role for Doug Wood on the continent.  He only speaks English and currently\thas little feel for the continent - which is neither American nor Britain.  English only players will ALWAYS fall behind\tlocals.  In every country where we need to have an impact, the impact MUST be in local language and should be with a\tlocal national.  GRA work is political (i.e., irrational and emotional). Brits are Europeans and Americans are people too \tdoesn't wash with local politicians.  The fact that some locals are willing to speak English is a trick.  The real business -\tparticularly regulatory and political business - is always done in local language.  Local GRA people, local country \tmanagers, local lawyers, etc. are not going to suffer an English only player gladly.  Let's be realistic about this.  Doug\tWood has no future on the continent.\n","5)\tResearch Specialists (and other such creatures):  We should not have such creatures.  That is a go nowhere job and it\tattracts go nowhere people.  More seriously, it would be a fantastic place for a direct out of the university eager Analyst\tto get an introduction to Enron before hitting a commercial desk.  That will also help ensure that future commercial teams\twill better understand the role of GRA.  The continuity argument doesn't wash.  Many commercial Analyst and Associates\trotate leaving continuity problems behind.  I am getting rid of my personal Research Specialist and will farm the work out\tin the future to rotating Analysts (watch out Gregor and Eric).  Reg Affairs should get rid of all of their Research Positions.\n","\tWe must ensure that enough first rotation Analysts are assigned to this task. I have several times in several different \tcountries seen Analyst level work outsourced to very highly paid consultants simply because GRA didn't have any\tresource.  Besides being expensive and wasteful, this costs a would be Analyst a great learning experience.  Perhaps\teach commercial country manager and each country specific GRA person should share a research analyst as a first\tround rotator.  All of our senior relationship work, etc. would be done much more professionally if that were the case and\tour consulting bills would fall.\n","6)\tCountry Managers:  Each country manager (such as Radmacher, Renggli, a hopefully soon to be new Italian one, etc.)\tshould be spending a meaningful (ca. 10 to 15%) of their time on GRA activities.  The commercial country manager should\tby definition have the best feel in Enron for what we need to do how and with whom in his/her country.  They must be told\tthat GRA leadership - together with you and the gas and power leadership executives - is part of their job. A new market\tmanager such as the future Italian country manager should consider GRA leadership an essential part of getting their\tmarket off of the ground.  Any commercial country manager who wants to 100% outsource GRA leadership in his/her\tcountry should be replaced.  Further, this should also reduce the need for too many VP and Sr Director level GRA people\tat this time.\n","7)\tItaly:  A Spaniard that speaks Italian is a good SHORT-term solution for Italy.  If we successfully hire a new Italian country\tmanager, he should get heavily involved in this initially.  Eventually, we will need a real-live Italian in Italy but we probably \tdon't need to look for him/her this quarter.  \n","8)\tLocal Politics, Local Language, Local National:  Should apply to:  Germany, The Netherlands, Austria/Switzerland \t(perhaps together, but then done by a German), France(&, perhaps Belgium), Spain, Italy.  I cannot imagine that we need any \tresource in former Communist Europe - Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, etc.  \n","I have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions; but, I am going to make this my final and conclusive list of GRA suggestions.  I look forward to working with you in this regard.  Already have engagements in the GRA space in Switzerland and Germany this year and am sure that there are many to come. Congratulations in you new role and best of wishes.  JT\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back.  \n","I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group.  It's attached.  Please take a look.  I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read.  Few points worth mentioning:\n","The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron.  List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ.The list also includes Hogan and Joskow  and Borenstein.  We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis.  However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., \"de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work.\"  Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the \"authors\" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course.  The analysis would not be a debate over \"To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc.\"  In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a \"Nixon goes to China\" scenario.  Please take a look at the list of participants.  Again, we can add to and subtract from the list.Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.)None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum.  It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan).The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project.  This is for two reasons:  1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study.If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project.\n","Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile.

His name is Bill Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri.

He stated that \"flexible\" standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some utility or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or different, then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for an exemption, not the other way around.

Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.\n"," \n","General Observations\n"," \n","The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. \n"," \n","FERC Deliverables\n","A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  \n","The first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.\n","The next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.\n","The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  \n","One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are allowed)?          Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?\n","Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financial hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.\n","Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.\n","NERC and GISB\n","A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.\n","Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.\n","Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.\n","There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.\n","The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.\n","Let me know if you have any questions.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 0.0 .

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market.\n","Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority.\n","The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of:\n","1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees5.  Dr. Gene Coyle6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne\n","The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. \n","Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role.  \n","Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego.\n","Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN and ORA.  \n","While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.\n","SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases.\n","UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well.  \n","TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.\n","Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.  \n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

MITI and the Government are currently examining why the initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and looking to move the 2003 review forward to next year. There are currently two multi party committees looking at the energy sector. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy. In addition, MITI is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to consider the next stage of deregulation. \n","As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved. Recently, with the addition of Kimura, we have increased our level of contact with senior political figures in Japan.\n","Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enron's views on issues relating to the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity deregulation. We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist in the deregulation process in a positive way.\n","What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be structured in the future.\n","Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will receive a cabinet position if Gov.

Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation).  Again, I don't recall this ever being an issue.  It seems to work:  outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 0.0 .

PATRICIA CAFFREY World Wildlife Fund-Bolivia Santa Cruz, Bolivia \n","Arena foes launch bid to defeat new plan By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Wednesday, October 4, 2000A handful of activists, including a Harris County Green Party official and several low-tax proponents, launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a second plan to build a downtown arena. Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year's anti-arena movement is not seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arena at all. Although this year's opponents lack the nearly $700,000 their higher-profile predecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish their rhetoric. \"Should we spend our city's limited resources on building up rich guys, or do we spend it building up our communities?\" asked activist DeWayne Lark, standing in front of City Hall. \"There will be no more corporate welfare in Harris County.\" Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday's event, which came about three weeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend than for who did. Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year's anti-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former city councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, also supports the new agreement. And although the Harris County Republican Party -- the primary organizer of the 1999 anti-arena effort -- has declined to support the new deal, it has not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped. In the GOP's stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented by Nathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professional sports are critical to a city's identity. Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston's image as a world-class city. \"Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at the drop of a hat,\" she said. And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservative political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major role in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager. Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arena campaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically active family that can raise large amounts of money. Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building sports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get involved in the anti-arena effort. Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the arena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this week to collect contributions. The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 1996 form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to build a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort also opposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extract a better deal from team owners. Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, and certainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal, which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points. Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profile contests. \"We never expected this to be a unanimous vote,\" said Jordan, the co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign, Let's Build it Together. \"Some people will vote against anything.\" \n","FRANCE: Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers.By Stuart Penson\n","10/03/2000Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2000.\n","PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe's power markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure on traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday. Scores of web-based trading platforms, offering a variety of functions, are expected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term, forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach, they told an energy conference.\"Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think we're going to see a big decline over the next six months,\" said Gilbert Toppin, principal of Deloitte Consulting's European e-business practice. \"Voice broking could become a distant memory,\" he told Reuters during the Powerisk 2000 conference. Leading the online charge in Europe's wholesale power market are EnronOnline, which launched last year, and HoustonStreet.com, which started up last week and is already planning to expand into Scandinavia. EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to a deal. HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange. The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen as lower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range of prices to clients. Also, online trading is anonymous, which is attractive to traders, said Mark Crosno, president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologies of the US. Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK, a consortium which runs a screen-based gas trading market and is planning to launch a power exchange.

And that would remain so until voice recognition enabled traders to \"talk\" to the screens on their desks. He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while online markets would capture a greater share of trading in short term, high volume contracts.

On Jan. 1, shares in Enron (news/quote), thegiant energy trading company in Houston, stood at $83.13. On Friday, Enronclosed at $31.57, down 9.7 percent for the week and 62 percent for theyear. The slide has destroyed more than $38 billion in shareholder value.In part, the company's problems are beyond its control, a result of thecollapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a comingglut in electricity. But the deepest wound at Enron is self-inflicted.Heavy insider selling, indecipherable accounting practices and a stream ofexecutive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gapbetween the company and Wall Street.\"The stock is trading under a cloud,\" says James S. Chanos, the presidentof Kynikos Associates, a hedge fund in New York. Mr. Chanos began bettingagainst Enron early this year and says he thinks that the company's sharesremain overvalued.Enron's problems came to a head on Aug. 14, when it announced that JeffreyK. Skilling, the chief executive, had quit for personal reasons.With his resignation, Mr. Skilling joined a half-dozen other top Enronmanagers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities. Still,the news came as a surprise because Mr. Skilling was named to his post onlyin February.Under the best of circumstances, the unexpected departure of a chiefexecutive rattles Wall Street. But hard-headed investors can usuallycomfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearlydeparted pooh-bah has left behind. Executives come and go, but numbers areforever.Unfortunately, Enron's books offer investors little succor. The complexityof the company's businesses and the way it reports its results makeunderstanding Enron's financial statements essentially impossible.Over the last decade, Enron has transformed itself from a simple naturalgas pipeline company into the world's largest trader of electricity andgas. Last year, about three-quarters of the company's cash flow came out ofthe company's wholesale services division, which includes its tradingoperations.But Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes. Are theyshort-term or long-term? Is the company hedged, or does it make\"directional bets\" on the prices of the commodities it trades?The answers are crucial, because they determine how much risk Enron hastaken to make its money. Big profits are nice. Big profits that come frombig, risky trades are a recipe for big, unexpected write-offs.Enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closelyrelated companies in \"related party\" transactions. The company says thatthe deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and thatthey have been approved by its board and outside auditors.But related-party deals can provide a convenient way for public companiesto shift losses to private affiliates. And Enron's disclosure about itsrelated-party deals, including billions of dollars in asset swaps with apartnership that until recently was controlled by the company's chieffinancial officer, is notably sketchy.In the good old days, like last year, companies could get away with theunlikeliest of accounting gimmicks, as long as their revenue and profitnumbers looked good. But Wall Street has become more demanding, as Enron islearning to its chagrin.Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, says the company is aware of investors'concerns. \"We've got credibility issues on the street, no question,\" Mr.Palmer says. \"We're looking at a lot of ways to give our investors moreinformation.\"Sooner would be better than later.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 0.0 .

I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file.     Here's why:                      - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule                        on market-based rate eligibility.                    - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very                       high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up                    reasons.  I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we                     know they don't care about.  I think the real reason                     is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the                     new rule comes out.                      - -  No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable                     to get kicked out, too.  They might not want to give                     MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new                     rule.                     - -    The best way to deal with that is to sit down with                      staff, go over the draft page by page, and see                     what more they want.  But that would take too long,                     because of staff's schedule.                     - -   The second best way is for me to call Dan                     Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that                     we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a                    deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft                    about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if                     that's good enough.  If he suggests different                     language, we'll have to put it in there.                     - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this                     through without saying anything to FERC in                     advance, we can file it, and just hope that the                     language we have about complying with the new                     rule  is good enough.   But that's really not what I                     would recommend. \n","         If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today.  If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. \n","             2.

We then met up with GM on the Friday.\n","Basically GM Petroleos (the main GM company) has entered into the Spanish equivalent of U.S. Ch.11. We have still not seen a copy of the petition presented to the Court, but this shd be forthcoming in the next day or so. The idea behind the petition for suspension of payments is to help companies that are facing liquidity problems. GM wd certainly fit that bill, although it remains doubtful as to whether GM can claim that its assets exceed its liabilities. The effect of the petition is to provide a moratorium on the repayment of any unsecured creditors, and on any judgments which those creditors obtain. The petition does not however prevent any preferred or secured creditors from enforcing their debts (in the latter case, to the extent of their security). \n","The judge to whom the petition is presented appoints 3 administrators. 2 are appointed from a list of accountants that the court maintains, and the third (also appointed by the court) is a representative of one of the top third of the list of creditors.\n","Once the administrators are appointed, the financial control of GMP will be their responsibility. They will authorize any future transactions, draw up the definitive list of creditors, and examine the solvency or otherwise of the company. In due course they will submit a report to the judge advising as to whether the company is insolvent or not. If insolvent, the Court will request that GMP provide a warranty for the difference between the amount owed and the assets. If this is not met within 14 days, subsidiary proceedings may be started to examine any personal liability of the management. \n","Parallel with this, the administrators will be speaking to all the creditors with a view to reaching an inter creditor arrangement on repayment of an agreed level of debt. Even though secured creditors are not precluded in enforcing their security during the suspension of payments procedure, it is usual for them too to take part in these discussions.\n","The outside lawyers seemed to think that the amount contained in the petition is equivalent to USD 85 million. We have no real idea how this is broken down, but the following shd be a rough guide:\n","VAT authority - USD 25 millionVeba - USD 15 millionEnron - USD 5 millionTotal - USD 3millionBank debt - USD 22 million - balance USD15 million\n","The Spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure may be difficult to prove as a debt. This exposure arises from the market difference we agreed to sell Dec. shipments to GMP (which then cd not put up the agreed purchase price to ensure delivery) and the current market price. Chris can confirm what these losses are today. We wd have to sue on those agreements (English arbitration), and then present to the administrators the arbitration judgments. However, as the administrators report is usually ready within 2-3months, I suspect that leaving aside any other factors there may be a timing problem here. \n","The Spanish lawyers said that GMP Board may have some personal liability issues. The Board is supposed to call a shareholders meeting if the company is in financial difficulties. Moreover, if there has been stripping out of assets from GMP, then those responsible may face criminal sanction\n","On the issue of preferences, it wd appear that Spanish law is somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand there is old jurisprudence to the effect that any and all transactions entered into by the debtor before its insolvency can be challenged by the administrators, irrespective of whether those transactions wd constitute a preference. On the other hand there is jurisprudence of equivalent weight which states that this is not the case, and that only preferences may be challenged. The Spanish lawyers were not able to say which system wd apply in the current scenario, but their insolvency lawyer made the following points:\n","there was no immediate threat from anyone against Enron or ECTRIC Spain. The whole issue about preferences is not dealt with until the report by the administrators is made to the judge. There is no chance of any nasty shocks like injunctions on Arcos etc.the payment to Enron of USD50 million at the same time as the VAT authorities were not being paid shd not overly worry Enron at the moment, as such payments are unlikely to be seen as a preference.most companies (even those judged insolvent) end up being dissolved voluntarily, probably as a result of the uncertainty of Spanish insolvency law. If a voluntary arrangement is reached it is unlikely to provide for anything but the most obvious preference (and the transfer of the strategic oil from GM to ECTRIC Spain wd not fall within this category)The VAT authorities (probably the main creditor) are not pro active in these sorts of proceedings and tend to take a back seat   \n","For what t is worth, GM made the following points:\n","GM's banks' inability to fund further prompted GMP management to make the petition (this despite the fact that GM had previously assured Enron that the GMP bank debt was minimal)petition is for Pta 10 billionGM lawyer said shd have made decision earlier to present the petitionGM lawyer also said that GMP had made what he called \"third party financing\" of Pta 6 billion, and accepted my suggestion that the administrators wd be asking for such funds back GMP wd be willing to put up Don Antonio's assets to secure Enron's continuing supplies to it (we have heard that many times before). Without such supplies GM stated that GMP was insolvent. They were not able to provide a reason as to why such assets cd not be pledged beforehandGMP sees Enron as the \"key\", namely that the supplies if resumed wd trigger the payment to GM of its outstanding receivables.  GM wants Enron to meet with the administrators next week.\n","It is early days but I wd suggest the following:\n","unlikely the old man's assets will be forthcominglikley the company will go into insolvencylikley the creditors will reach a voluntary arrangementtherefore unlikely there will be any clawback of earlier payments/strategic storage oilequally, unlikely Enron will receive any recognition of its MTM debt \n","Chris, let me know if there is anything you wd like to add/clarify. otherwise once we get the petition we will advise further. tks\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

A little background I'll bore you with:  after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups.  When Andre left, we reduced the corporate function to a \"default provider\" role -- if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) would help identify competent resources in the area.  With the reorganization of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled (led by John Brindle).  John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week.  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.  It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation.

HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20 hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR, and Drew had his team there for us.\n","2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground.

We've established a company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:\n","1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any \"headroom\" for REC purchases.Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in order for the \"greening\" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.  HOWEVER, it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.  I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some of the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs cost).  We will then need to decide the following: a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for the RECs; b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs; c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change what they are currently paying for power.4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go 100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the \"best\" press for this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).

Some times, even if no new information is provided, people simply feel better because an effort is made to communicate with them.  People appreciated your open-ness and the frank-ness with which you addressed some of the tougher questions regarding long term employment viability or security.  On the other hand, people read a message into the statements regarding the fact that retention packages will be developed for key individuals.  They read that if they didn't get a retention package they should be looking for a job because they are not key.  Perhaps, bluntly, that is exactly what the message is but now you have many people spending their time trying to figure out the \"definition of key individual.\"  People like to feel important (non-core is, for them, non-important) and absent that they worry about every little thing - many of these no one can help or mitigate.  Finally, people took comfort in the comment regarding how long it might take for all to be sold (i.e,. approx. 3 years) and understood and felt better that no fire sale will take place.    \n","My biggest recommendations are:- We need to keep up our communication efforts; people feel important and feel better if folks make an effort to communicate;  Pete and I (and others) need to work on  communicating further with each of our teams and on motivating them to support the company during these tough times but both you and Jim should continue to  update people as often as possible.- We need to move quickly to identify our key people so that we can be effective about retention efforts;  my own view is that you start with the field; those are your  most critical individuals because they are running the asset.  - We need to continue to deliver the message that the merger is a good thing and that it is not simply another \"life\" bought out by Enron (i.e., many people felt and still  feel that there is still a chance Enron might make on its own and would pay the breakage fee to get out of the Dynegy deal - this may be more hope than belief but  that is the case).\n","A key distinction that I noted in the meeting today was that it sounds as though we will move forward very aggressively to sell all of the EGAS assets.  There is no longer the attitude or position that: if the asset has good earnings and good cashflow, then what's the hurry.  The message today (and forgive me if I mis-read it) was: we will put together a corp. development group that will be focused on selling EGAS assets even if they are performing assets - cash is still king and will continue to be until the merger.\n","Hope this helps and THANK YOU very much for taking the time to talk to us.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a \"mark\" on the company's liquidity position.  \n","Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?

The amendment does not surprise me though. \n"," In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in '91, we developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included--the thinking by the various State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones, funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately unearthed.  It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and consultation process....not only when objects were unearthed, but simply putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to construction.  (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans together..Haha!!)   As I said, I've not read the amendment , but hopefully it only legally requires 'notice'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing law, I've rarely seen  a 'notice' that didn't crack the door or sound the alarm of further buerocratic opportunity!\n","For your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and he's a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ; yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to 'perceived economic opportunity'.   Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match, and is proud of it!! --which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes you--he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and \"plays\"in whatever stage opportunity is presented him--as long as he can be the center of attention.  The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has his own!!  Check it out--it's a hoot!!  He has been chief for about 25 years (and I'm guessing he's maybe in his early 50's).  The Seminoles have recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely a \"My way or the highway\" kind of guy--he loves you, hates you, or ignores you--and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn't like, he'll know no limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!!

If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.

As follows:\n","Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.\n","1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.\n","Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

He represents a company called IdleAire Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also, these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.\n","IdleAire's  goal is to: \n","\"........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest truck stop electrification network in the world.

Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.  \n","I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do.

(EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.

There were a rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston.  Attached is a memo we handed out to employees, but basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.   3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process.   a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.

From your message I think there may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us.  We understood that your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to as-yet-undetermined people, along with various Enron material.  They also wanted to post it on Enron's public web site.But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your intranet -  for educational use only for your internal folks.  If this is correct, we would have no problem with it. In fact, we have posted the op-ed on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron employee for internal use only.  If you want you could just post a link to the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research on the topic.If I misunderstood you, and you do want to redistribute the piece to third-parties -- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our intellectual property and  branding issues.  Obviously, we would need to talk some more about this.  I hope this helps.On a somewhat-related note, we are also getting sucked more and more into the California vortex, and being asked to help in areas that are not our traditional business, such as expert witness testimony and policy issues.  While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must maintain a neutral and independent posture.  This is sometimes a difficult path to navigate, but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron:1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies.  We are considering how best to broadcast our assessment, without impinging on our core business, or becoming an expert witness.  We think a workshop, similar to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work, where we would present our findings and issue a report.2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West - especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy.  This would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or university.  Again the reults would go to our clients, but could be released to a wider audience, and a workshop might help highlight the release.Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron.  We would need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort , but the work would be CERA's independent research and we would stand fully behind it.Hope all is well. ...Peter .  \n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: 1.0 .

I realize that there is some concern that Wanda is a litigation threat, so for the purposes of soliciting legal advice and in anticipation of litigation, I am forwarding my recollection of today's meeting to you:\n","Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as \"unfair and discriminatory\" treatment.  When I asked her what she meant specifically (and did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she did not intend the legal meaning of those terms;  rather, she, on  a \"personal\" level,  felt that the company should have treated her better.  She mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron, that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory (because Sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the company.I described several options for her:Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization;Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick again)Take severence under the standard package;Take severence as a \"business reorg\" but consult with Enron for a period.At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't particularly happy about any of the  alternatives), but at the end of the discussion expressed interest in the second option.A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints about how she had been treated.  Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about job assignments.  I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some insensitivity.  I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated her unfairly.Wanda did complain about many things, but never once complained about her pay at Enron.\n","Mary, these are my recollections from today.

We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities.  However, while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?]  Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market.  \n","We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market.  [deleted text] Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron.

Mike sent the \"final\" versions of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver to his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom you've decided to circulate.This email does, however, include a \"summary\" of our proposed legislation.  But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute \"to the world,\" or if we'll need instead to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a \"one pager\" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively.We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team could propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition?We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.  You note that attached to the email is a \"legislative fix\" to AB1X that could solve the credit issue and an attached set of \"taking points\" related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying that DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section (legislative solution) under the topic \"create a real competitive retail market in California.\"  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.\n","If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n","Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n","Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit the elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development of distributed generation. Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investor-owned and municipal utilities\n","Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from the utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n","Permitting and Air Quality IssuesDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs or greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission and therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale generation faces.  \n","Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facilities. In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects.  These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n","3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities \n","Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers.Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s credit risk concerns.Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward.\n","Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n","Ambiguous Ratemaking AuthorityThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n","Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then refuse to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers. Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power PurchasesIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to employ to permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it is extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensure DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it is difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n","Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk \n","We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit risk issues.  We have identified three options:\n","Amend AB1XThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incurred by DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n","Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and through Contract LanguageThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly more time to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled, =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n","Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit RiskAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to accept other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit, cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through contract amendments.\n","4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n","Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They differ only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  All credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are likely.  \n","CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operation in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced to date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess the flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply.  California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement.  \n","Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's severe supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the current pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n","CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California should view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n","5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=01,s Electricity Crisis\n","This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We will deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n","As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's crisis must focus on four issues:\n","Increase supplyDecrease demandEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity marketReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n","Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years.  Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n","The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legislation are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve those efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2) transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected air districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions.\n","Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished most effectively and quickly in two ways:\n","Buy-down demandCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fund to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g., through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&Deal Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n","Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary CurtailmentTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n","An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price for hour-ahead power in real time. Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification.Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n","The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include:\n","=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, particularly in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation resources.reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state.fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding. \n","We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 times that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n","Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehicle: SB27XThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego were customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove the prohibition against Direct Access.\n","Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department of Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration.  \n","In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procurement is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load.\n","Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative vehicle: AB18XUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand.  In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extended period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to participate in that market.\n","California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without =01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California could amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year period.  In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways: First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB 1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have received from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they have accrued due to the retail price cap.\n","End Message.\n","\n","Prediction: nan .

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money. A San Francisco ice cream parlor, a costume store, a psychiatrist's office and a karate studio are among a number of small businesses that should be receiving payments from the near bankrupt utility. After checking her books, ACT Costume Shop manager Callie Floor was surprised to find that the utility owes her $100 for a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992.

But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis.

Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $1.3 million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they did receive raises. Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers.

Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors.\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis and U.S. lawmakers call for price caps on power LOS ANGELES -- Half of California's congressional delegation gathered with Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep.

The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again. A resolution passed 48-7 asked President George W. Bush, Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restore the regulation of natural gas that ended in 1992. Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years. We're not seeing adequate action from the federal government,\" said the author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Atwater. Republicans refused to vote for the resolution, complaining that it was an attack on the GOP Bush administration. Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E. Frank received $760,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $1.35 million last year. And Edison Mission Energy CEO Alan J. Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand. The council voted 3-2 Wednesday to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy plants in the city.

I thought it might be helpful to provide a few usefulfacts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may bedriving the state's energy costs higher.\n","Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was payingroughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct resultof the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, evenlaudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsidesof utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governorshould know better.\n","Consider the facts:\n","--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest\n","investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to\n","below investment grade by every major rating agency.\n","Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to\n","sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.\n","--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state\n","Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power\n","purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the\n","Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an\n","ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could\n","be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in\n","the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the\n","full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional\n","generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or\n","have under contract, to meet customer demand.\n","However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of\n","state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full\n","net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know\n","for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say\n","how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will\n","the ISO.)\n","--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n","informed the Independent System Operator that it could not\n","force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,\n","both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money.

But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis. Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid $950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 1999. Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $1.3 million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis. In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they did receive raises. Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors.\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis and U.S. lawmakers call for price caps on power LOS ANGELES -- Half of California's congressional delegation gathered with Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again. A resolution passed 48-7 asked President George W. Bush, Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restore the regulation of natural gas that ended in 1992. Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years.

Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E. Frank received $760,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $1.35 million last year. And Edison Mission Energy CEO Alan J. Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand. The council voted 3-2 Wednesday to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy plants in the city.

The Governorshould know better.\n","Consider the facts:\n","--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest\n","investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to\n","below investment grade by every major rating agency.\n","Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to\n","sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.\n","--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state\n","Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power\n","purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the\n","Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an\n","ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could\n","be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in\n","the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the\n","full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional\n","generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or\n","have under contract, to meet customer demand.\n","However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of\n","state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full\n","net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate.

This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power....

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money.

But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis. Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid $950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 1999. Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $1.3 million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis. In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they did receive raises. Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors.\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis and U.S. lawmakers call for price caps on power LOS ANGELES -- Half of California's congressional delegation gathered with Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again.

Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years.

Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E.

Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes.

If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money.

But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis.

Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer.

Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years.

Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand. The council voted 3-2 Wednesday to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy plants in the city. Register staff writers, The Associated Press and Knight Ridder Newspapers contributed to this report. \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Friday, April 20, 2001 \n","Shed light on costs Unfortunately, California citizens will remain in the dark for at least another month about the details of Gov.

Mr. Klayman remains hopeful. \"We're confident any judge who sees this will have to release the documents,\" he said.A similar but separate case, brought by several newspapers, will be heard May 18 in a San Diego Superior Court. \"This is a huge financial burden on the taxpayers without an opportunity for the taxpayers to scrutinize the terms,\" Hal Fuson, chairman of the government affairs committee of the California Newspaper Publishers Association, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \"The general climate surrounding the governor's approach to this has been one of secrecy.\"The governor's position is that releasing the details now could make it harder for the state to get the best prices for electricity. But given that the governor has mismanaged this crisis so far, it's clear that this is precisely the sort of crisis the public needs to scrutinize and for which the Public Records Act was designed.The governor should end this legal wrangling and release the documents to which citizens are entitled. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","End To Deregulation of Nevada Power\n","CARSON CITY, Nev.

Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power\n","SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -\n","FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and\n","Electric Company\n","There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effectPacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had onenergy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few usefulfacts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may bedriving the state's energy costs higher.\n","Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was payingroughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct resultof the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, evenlaudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsidesof utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governorshould know better.\n","Consider the facts:\n","--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest\n","investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to\n","below investment grade by every major rating agency.\n","Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to\n","sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.\n","--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state\n","Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power\n","purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the\n","Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an\n","ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could\n","be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in\n","the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the\n","full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional\n","generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or\n","have under contract, to meet customer demand.\n","However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of\n","state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full\n","net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was\n","only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and\n","was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the\n","lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to\n","20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.\n","--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass\n","along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market\n","purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite\n","existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).\n","PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly\n","$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know\n","for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say\n","how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will\n","the ISO.)\n","--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n","informed the Independent System Operator that it could not\n","force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,\n","both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to\n","purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the\n","next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying\n","the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also\n","sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining\n","order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to\n","continue selling to it.\n","--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with\n","FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the\n","February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.\n","--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge\n","Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,\n","Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell\n","electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.\n","Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they\n","sought such assurances.\n","--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11\n","filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the\n","\"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\n","procurement costs\" caused by the state's failure to assume the\n","full procurement responsibility.\n","--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued\n","an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint\n","against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its\n","February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf\n","of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.\n","--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's\n","office acknowledged the State's \"bill for energy purchases\n","will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling\n","last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once\n","DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than\n","force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely\n","that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the\n","utilities' costs, not the combination of both.\n","--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of\n","publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.\n","--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid\n","buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out what it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the department's deputy director in charge of power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep the lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see, how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost later.\" But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point does the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under discussion,\" Maviglio said. The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax that stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hart said. That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which gets its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Hart said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand. \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said. The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid. \"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards, and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as best we can.\" Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection. Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million in the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said. Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said. But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt hour April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax news service. PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state's increased spending. \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporters. Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order, PG&E said. Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department could further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance the power purchases through a bond offering. The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded. A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch. Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving payments again from Edison and PG&E. These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20 percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money from the utilities since November. The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for new power deliveries. But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online. So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether to order Edison and PG&E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed for past deliveries. \n","The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com.

The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled for May 3. \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praising the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice. SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings. The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen steeply. Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its own plants, nearly tripled between October and January. And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of normal to date. But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the board to reconsider. \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage all at once,\" said Marian Ender. Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manager at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee. The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more electricity available in the future. \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu said. Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124 million annually for SMUD, and a special 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent years, will go into an emergency fund. \"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said director Susan Patterson. The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee. The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly bill hovers around $20. \"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay for usage.\" Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more. But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run farmers' wells and irrigation systems. \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby agriculture,\" Keat said. The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which includes a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of Sacramento County. They will not affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators. \"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times, it's PG&E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner. While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first of many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will be the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years. To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fall hardest on the heaviest household users. SMUD's old residential rates were divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier of 14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27 cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month. Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industries will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultural rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residential rates 19 percent. Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will pay a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the surcharge on their baseline electricity usage. Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at (888) 742-7683. \n","The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woesBy Emily BazarBee Capitol Bureau(Published April 20, 2001) On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California from its deepening energy troubles. After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov. Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the federal government's role in easing California's electricity woes. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned that if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects. \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ... We can't sit back in Washington and let California suffer.\" Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent three days at fund-raisers and speaking engagements across the state. In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis, Lieberman told them he's strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary caps on the wholesale price of electricity. But the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, is a fierce free-market advocate who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his mind. If FERC doesn't act soon, Lieberman said he will support legislation sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force FERC to impose temporary caps. He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week. Lieberman's first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast, an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders. At the breakfast, speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates the state's energy crisis. Before launching into a song from \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians the truth throughout the ordeal. Davis was solemn in his remarks, and his calm demeanor belied his behavior Tuesday, when he reportedly erupted in an obscene tirade during a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. \"I'm going to tell you the truth, Steve. We have a problem,\" Davis said to the singer. \"But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our part.\" \n","The Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas \n","Temporary step will give it time for overall planningBy Jonathan Heller UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout. The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants. \"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in,\" City Councilwoman June Rady said. \n","The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January: Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwest part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning Department. Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant on Mission Avenue in west Escondido. CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant. Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet. Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can be filed with the city. The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray Davis. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. They said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisis, which is expected to come to a head this summer. \"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer, we should not be the ones to stand in the way,\" Pfeiler said. Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less. \"The governor is not solving the problem,\" Waldron said. \"It's up to local governments to try to do what they can.\" Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the council's decision would upset his plans. \"Our timetable is still not fully defined,\" Rowley said. \"Obviously there's a lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be processed.\" Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas for the city to consider alternative power sources. David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he said. \"Escondido has 65 square miles,\" he said. \"But 2,500 acres could be employed to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy.\" Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated from windmills. The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek inexpensive, stable energy rates. The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate deals with the city. To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, such as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the only energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the regional energy grid. San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any deals to buy power. It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form such a district. San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under the state Constitution. Escondido is a general-law city. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says \n","Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backingBy Bill Ainsworth UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. \"I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,\" Davis said. Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. \"Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,\" said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. \"The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,\" FERC ruled. In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. \"It baffles me that we've found the problem -- anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,\" said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls \n","By Gary GentileASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act to control the wholesale price of energy. \"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates,\" said Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs. \"I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon as we can.\" Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan solution. \"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of electricity,\" Davis said. \"We have agreed to work cooperatively across party lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters.\" \"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is absurd,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. \"So many of our colleagues are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the authority to regulate these two items.\" The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small generators. \"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, because we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of power, you should be allowed to turn them on,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts during a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be made. Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls and favor free markets. Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power. \"We're not talking about artificial caps,\" Harman said. \"We should insist that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go that route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight.\" The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified approach in Washington. \"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's role seriously,\" said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. \"We clearly understand what our assignment is today and I think we're going to work together in a bipartisan way to get that done.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers \n","By Michael LiedtkeASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating. The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market, said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood. All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410 million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy said was enough electricity for 3 million homes. \"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),\" Raudy said. \"We have heard so much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime. That is what we are worried about.\" Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity. After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27. But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of this month. If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said. PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers during Thursday's hearing. \"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons, not to game the system,\" he said. California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence. Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power capacity, according to the PUC. The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish to a record low if the recent drought continues. \"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our needs,\" Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity supply. The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California's energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state. Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency's public meetings. In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the regulators should become more involved in PG&E's bankruptcy case. The San Francisco-based utility is challenging the PUC's authority in the case. The PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May 3 meeting. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Attorney general taking two energy companies to court \n","ASSOCIATED PRESS April 19, 2001 SACRAMENTO =01) Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his investigation into the state's electricity market. Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. failed to produce certain documents by March 19, despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept confidential, Lockyer said Thursday. Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldn't be kept confidential, even though he says they've been assured the sensitive documents would not be released. The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in the state's electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs. Mirant spokesman Bill O'Neel said the company is cooperating with the attorney general's office. \"At this moment, we have our legal team working to pull together the documentation the attorney general has requested,\" O'Neel said. Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage, said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"We're committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General Lockyer is conducting,\" Wheatley said. \"It's the understanding of our management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will be kept confidential.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue \n","Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.S. must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers. \n","By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers \n","This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. \"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,\" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market.\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. \"In fact, it's just the opposite.\"Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state.After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state.\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong.\"Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he \"ignored\" her appeal for federal assistance. Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices.The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices.The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.\"We're not withholding capacity--no one is,\" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. \"With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.\"In other developments Thursday:* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in \"deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,\" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said.The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome.But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate.\"* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,\" Wood said.Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said.* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs.But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer.Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries.\"It's not a huge amount,\" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, \"but every little bit helps.\"--- Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

They're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them. And they're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many of the 47,894 creditors that PG&E owes money to, according to a list filed with the bankruptcy judge, are banks, power companies, lawyers and the like. But a surprising number are businesses that, at first blush, might seem unlikely to be power company creditors. Many businesses -- like the ACT costume rental shop -- didn't know or had forgotten that PG&E had run up a tab. And since the list didn't say how much they're owed, businesses had to guess. \"How about that?\" said costume shop manager Callie Floor, when told she had PG&E money coming to her. Floor, checking her books, said it looks like PG&E forgot to pay its $100 bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992. \"We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events,\" she said. \"That's probably what it was.\" Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PG&E owes him. \"But I'll take it,\" he said. \"PG&E has taken advantage of the consumer for so long. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E can go under and stay under.\" Of course, PG&E may wind up paying pennies on the dollar, if anything, because that's how bankruptcies work. The notion is depressing, which psychiatrists are used to. KARATE STUDIO GETS HITKarate master Scott Morton, whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is also a creditor, said karate is all about fairness and integrity, which PG&E seems to be even shorter on than cash. \"I think the bankruptcy stinks,\" Morton said. \"All the money is going around and around, it's all the same company.\" The karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers at PG&E headquarters. Morton, a black belt who does not take treachery lightly, said he was \"pretty sure\" the check cleared, but maybe not. NO BIG DEAL FOR SOMEAt Beauchamp's Welding and Repair in Petaluma, owner Dean Beauchamp wasn't concerned. \"They don't owe us enough to worry about,\" he said. \"Less than $100, I'd guess.\" Beauchamp's shop does small jobs for the big utility. \"They've been really good about sending us a check. Once in a great while, something will get misplaced, and I guess that's how our name got on the list.\" Yolanda Fletcher, the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service, says the utility probably owes her about $100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate slide show. Larry Mitchell, proprietor of the award-winning Mitchell's Ice Cream shop on San Jose Avenue, believes that PG&E may owe him $500 for a corporate ice cream social. \"That would cover the ice cream, the toppings, the dishes and the spoons,\" he said. The utility's rocky road may be metaphorical, but an ice cream store's rocky road is the real thing, he said, and being owed $500 by a bankrupt company is not peaches and cream. UNEXPECTED NAMESThe list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San Francisco Fire Department, the Yosemite Fund, The Chronicle and PG&E's own library petty cash fund. Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the perpetual PG&E foe known as TURN, or The Utility Reform Network, which stands to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from PG&E for its work as an \"intervener,\" or utility watchdog. Among the utility's more sensible business partners is the Beale Street sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PG&E's headquarters building in San Francisco. Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions, proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PG&E on a strictly pay-as-you-go business. Chen, the owner of Cafe Leah at 25 Beale St., is often hired to send up a $40 tray of sandwiches to PG&E corporate officers. When he does so, he insists on cash up front because PG&E, who is the restaurant's landlord, insists on cash every month from Chen. \"That's the way we've always done it, payment right away,\" he said. \"That way there's no hassle later on.\" E-mail Steve Rubenstein at srubenstein@sfchronicle.com and Chuck Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developments in California's energy crisis The Associated PressFriday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state1004EDT0161.DTL&type=3Dnews , , -- (04-20) 07:04 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis: FRIDAY:<-- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.-- Southern California Edison plans a 1:30 p.m. conference call with itscreditors.-- Edison executives discuss the state's move to buy thier transmission linesat a 9:30 a.m. briefing in Sacramento.<THURSDAY:< -- The Public Utility Commission launches an investigation into whether a key block of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants off line. -- The commission tables until May 3 a vote on whether the PUC should become more involved in Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy case.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------California utility wants to boost Mohave power plant production \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0926EDT0156.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 06:26 PDT BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- With many opposed to allowing Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave Generating Station, the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here. The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nev. Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current cap of 70 percent of the plant's capacity and to do so for more than 20 hours. ``We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling blackouts (California has experienced recently),'' Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso. ``That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States already, and now they want variances to do even more damage,'' Urso said. Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell, who presents the Bullhead City area, doesn't see it that way. ``They'll only run it up to full power for very short periods, and we need that for the power shortages,'' Sockwell said this week. ``We've already got pollution anyway, so what's another hour of a darker plume every now and then?'' Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust, which monitors the plant's operation, said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 1,200 times during the last calendar year. The trust sued, and the company was fined $180,000. The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local opponents of Edison's request. Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes. At peak capacity, the plant can produce 1,580 megawatts of electricity but is required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns Edison owns 56 percent of the plant. The rest is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (20 percent), Nevada Power (14 percent) and the Salt River Project in Phoenix (10 percent). Nevada Power has been trying to sell its share in the generating station to AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has been trying to purchase both Edison's and Nevada Power's shares but has run into snags. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission approve the Nevada Power sale in October but suspended that approval on Marcy 29 for at least 60 days. In January, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a five-year moratorium on such sales about the same time. ,2001 Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PG&E owes money to several small businesses, unlikely creditors \n","Friday, April 20, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/04/20/state0503EDT0125.DTL&type=3Dnews (04-20) 02:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several small fry are among the big fish in a pond full of creditors to which ailing Pacific Gas and Electric owes money.

But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would \"want to do the right thing\" by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. \"We are going to go through this thing extensively,\" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"There are a lot of concerns about the valuation.\" Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. \"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,\" Burton said. Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. \"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,\" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. \"There will be a big effort to try and work something out.\" Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. \"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,\" Bryson said. Bankruptcy, he said, \"is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process.\" It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. \"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,\" said Carol Coale, an energy- industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \"This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.\" Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. \"This is a very good deal for the state,\" he said. \"It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.\" Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. \"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Edison gets off scot-free.\" Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. \"The deal on the table is still salvageable,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone.\" For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. \"We're just at the initial stage,\" he said. \"We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.\" E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page?A - 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Who will pay the most for power? Posted at 9:46 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 JOHN WOOLFOLK \n","AND MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News \n","State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt-hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. Now, much of that is up in the air. Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s move into bankruptcy court. ``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. Among them: How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his April 5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioners said their increase would take effect immediately. PUC vote May 14 Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline. Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over 200 percent of that level. But that's where the similarities end. Differences The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's Web site. Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of 7.5 percent. TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate increase of nearly 30 percent. ``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. Utilities want surcharge Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent per kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. In March, the commission approved an additional three-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Credit-raters put state on watch Posted at 9:41 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 19, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS \n","Mercury News \n","All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on a credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's budget. The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will be spent. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for the company. The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.'' A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected. Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon. \n","Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Power company executives going without bonuses LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of California's power crisis. Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid $950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 1999. Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $1.3 million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis. In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they did receive raises. Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors.\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Davis and U.S. lawmakers call for price caps on power LOS ANGELES -- Half of California's congressional delegation gathered with Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose energy price caps. Limiting wholesale prices, they argued, is essential if the state is to avert the energy crisis threatening California's economy. ``A big piece of this solution is federal. It's a four-letter word: F-E-R-C,'' said U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that would have to approve price caps. The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas. The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel, but Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward. ``The signal that has to come from FERC,'' Davis said, ``is, `You're charging too much for electricity. The electricity is not worth driving California into an economic grave.'?'' Curt H,bert Jr., the FERC chairman, has argued that caps would encourage generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building new plants in California. The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is getting gouged on the open market. ``There is an anti-free market enterprise mechanism in play here,'' said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, noting that natural gas in parts of New Mexico costs one-third what it does in California. The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the simple result of supply and demand. Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, attended, but left before speaking with reporters.\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Generators cutting electric output; regulators want to find out why Published Friday, April 20, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MICHAEL BAZELEY \n","Mercury News \n","State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative energy providers are withholding electricity from the state's stressed power grid. The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to determine whether the small power generators -- which provide about one-fourth of the state's electrical power -- have legitimate business reasons for scaling back their output. Known as ``qualifying facilities,'' or QFs, many of the generators have been either scaling back output or shutting down entirely -- contending that the state's two largest utilities owe them $700 million. ``The critical question is: Will we be able to rely on these facilities into the high-demand summer months?'' PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said. The financially strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, stopped paying the power generators several months ago. The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments, and some generators started receiving payments this week. But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they are owed, said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, which consists of 10 alternative power producers. ``We're outraged,'' Raudy said. \n","Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5628. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","FERC remains an unlikely rescuer The federal agency hews to a hands-off policy on power rates. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County RegisterWashington - Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency better look for some other solution. Even the possible short- term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little, too late. Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. And many are looking to see if President George W. Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. \"I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,'' Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. \" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing.\" The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. \"Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,'' Massey said. While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. \"We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. \"It's important to me that we address the summer,'' Breathitt said, but she said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday. Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be \"better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency.'' Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene \"is putting the whole grid at risk,'' said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. \"We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close.'' Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. \"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,'' Feinstein said. \"What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.'' But once again, timing could be a problem. Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,'' Feinstein said. \"Please, please, please, President Bush, process your nominees.'' \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks, can't agree on caps They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal agencies to conserve power this summer. April 20, 2001 By DENA BUNISThe Orange County Register Los Angeles - Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done about runaway wholesale power prices in California. \"We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the energy providers of natural gas and electricity\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. \"And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater rollbacks than there already have been.\" The lawmakers did not, however, come to a consensus over the issue of price caps - something Davis and other Democrats, particularly Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to institute. Davis met behind closed doors for 90 minutes with Feinstein and 27 of the 52 House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX. Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach; Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Santa Ana; and Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar. They emerged with a promise to meet again soon, this time in Washington, and with a four-pronged strategy to avert disaster this summer. The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including military facilities, to conserve energy this summer, and asking FERC to find a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California. Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis' $850 million conservation program. Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation measures. Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks. That measure, he said, will include a direction to FERC to expand its investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable. \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Energy notebook Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas April 20, 2001 From Register news services Sacramento - The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to regulate soaring natural gas prices once again.

Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as 11 times higher than elsewhere in the nation since November, an industry consultant told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday. \"I think it's only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this country in the last 100 years.

Top Edison officials forego bonus, take 45% pay cut Rosemead - Edison International's top officers received no bonuses in 2000 and generally took pay cuts of about 45 percent as the Southern California company's utility segment was forced to write off $4.2 billion spent buying overpriced power in the state's deregulated electricity market, according to SEC disclosures the company filed Thursday. Edison International Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson received $1.62 million in salary and other compensation, compared with $3.04 million last year. Southern California Edison CEO Stephen E.

Fohrer received $584,000 in salary and other compensation, compared with $922,000 last year. Edison's compensation committee did give Bryson an incentive to pull the company out of its quagmire, awarding stock options with a present-day value calculated at $7.26 million. But Bryson won't be able to profit from those options -- which vest over the next five years -- any time soon. The lowest price he can exercise the options at is $20 -- and Edison stock is trading at $11. PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives Sacramento - Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity. With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much of the state's energy. These alternative generators - known in the industry as \"qualifying facilities,\" or QFs - have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimated $700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled Southern California Edison. In other developments: California's Public Utilities Commission delayed until May 3 a decision on whether it will investigate how Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy is going to affect customers. Unbowed by Gov. Gray Davis' endorsement of Calpine's proposed power plant, San Jose officials said they may yet have the last word on the controversial project. The city could sue the California Energy Commission or attempt to block the project by refusing to extend water and sewer lines or annex several acres of needed land, they said. PG&E Corp. won final approval to build a $350 million power plant in San Diego County capable of supplying electricity to 500,000 homes. The Escondido City Council has decided to take a break from considering a rush of proposals by developers trying to build plants before peak summer demand.

On April 13, in response to\n","the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO\n","sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid\n","accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial\n","support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this\n","notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the\n","assurances contained in the letter.\n","--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy\n","was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for\n","the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don't believe, nor\n","have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to\n","the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and\n","marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings\n","order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"\n","What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costshave come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energyneeds, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits hascome as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC ordersthat the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders wereissued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally toPG&amp;E and SCE.\n","Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, andthe DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect ofthe FERC order since mid-February.\n","Some generators have suggested that California has been paying acredit penalty since December, when the utilities' deterioratingfinancial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to befar more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementationhas created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E'sChapter 11 filing.\n","CONTACT: PG&amp;E Co. |              News Department, 415/973-5930-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","J.D.

Phillips and Laura HeinauerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n","03/07/2001The Wall Street JournalA2(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n","WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.\"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,\" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. \"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of this,\" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government relations. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. \"We'll be circulating them very broadly,\" Mr. Rice said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. \"That makes it a much more serious issue,\" Mr. Rice said. \"We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.\" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. \"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,\" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate Beneficiaries\n","Top 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance forfiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millions\n","Boeing $3,335Bechtel Group $1,075Distributed Processing Systems $388Willbros Group $387United Technologies $334Raytheon $156General Electric $150Halliburton $136Enron $135LSI Logic $120\n","Source: Ex-Im Bank\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. \n","Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish ReformsBy Germana CanziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n","03/07/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n","LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.com\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\n","LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, \"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later.\" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. \"Trust me,\" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. \"There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare.\" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion.\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report.A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. \"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,\" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently. Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and South, respectively. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 07/03/01 01-04G\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. \"This is not a done deal,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. \"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. -- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.Some storage buying occurred in Texas \"if they could make it work,\" a trader said. \"It was a pretty uneventful day,\" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather.

But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. \"That makes it a much more serious issue,\" Mr. Rice said. \"We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.\" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. \"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,\" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate Beneficiaries\n","Top 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance forfiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millions\n","Boeing $3,335Bechtel Group $1,075Distributed Processing Systems $388Willbros Group $387United Technologies $334Raytheon $156General Electric $150Halliburton $136Enron $135LSI Logic $120\n","Source: Ex-Im Bank\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. \n","Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish ReformsBy Germana CanziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n","03/07/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n","LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.com\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\n","LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, \"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later.\" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. \"Trust me,\" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. \"There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare.\" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion.\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report.A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. \"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,\" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently. Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and South, respectively. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 07/03/01 01-04G\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. \"This is not a done deal,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. \"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. -- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.Some storage buying occurred in Texas \"if they could make it work,\" a trader said. \"It was a pretty uneventful day,\" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather. Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu. -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com\n","Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
