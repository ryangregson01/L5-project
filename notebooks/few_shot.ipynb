As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanfordeconomist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more thananyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,Australia, and California.

Perhaps you can forward this.\n"," I just received a phone call from Carl Shapiro. He began by saying that he and several people from the Business School (Severin Borenstein, George Cluff) are planning an electricity deregulation mini-conference that sounds exactly like ours, and wanted to check so that we don't step on each others toes and perhaps can do it together. They even had October in mind for their timing. We are further along then they are, however.\n"," My first response to him was that because our event is alumni-initiated, I am not sure that they would want this to be other than a GSPP event. By the end of our conversation, we were discussing GSPP co-sponsorship with two other campus units: IBER and UEI. Neither are schools. Carl is Director of the Institute for Business and Economics Research, a campus-wide organized research unit (and Rich Gilbert assists in this). UEI is Severin's group, the university-wide energy research institute. Carl suggested that they could help with administration and perhaps some modest support if we do this together. Carl himself is on the Market Surveillance Committee of the ISO, and I think would hope to have some speaking role. He also mentioned Frank Wolak of Stanford as a speaker.\n"," I think it would be good to try and work out this co-sponsorship. It would mean allowing some of them (Carl and Severin?) into our planning group. There connections are probably very valuable to us, and they really are on the same wavelength. The alternative of GSPP going it alone after this initiative seems to me to be bad feelings and crossed-wires that would be no good to anyone.

In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.\n","Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).\n","Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under \"information required\" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:\n","(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\n","The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.\n","As to the \"timely basis\" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:\n","\"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.\n","The change is to add \"appropriate\" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of \"appropriate\" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like \"consistent with ...\" or \"promote competition\" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.\n","Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.\n","Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.. \n","[/INST] \n","Response: The text does contain personal information in a professional context.

One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered.Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate increase.Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enoughEnron able to take low profile.SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing could be achieved.Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.  \n","Out of the Room\n","Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable resolution.\n","Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks\n","Judge asked everyone to consider how to \"Share the Pain\" for Thursday's meeting and said not to expect any \"win:win\" scenario. His view is that FERC is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose this, I believe.Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.. \n","[/INST] \n","Response: The text does contain personal information in a professional context.
