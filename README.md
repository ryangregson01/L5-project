# Automatic Sensitivity Identification with Generative AI

## Project Description

Many collections of documents, such as emails, cannot be released to the public because they contain sensitive information. Previous literature has addressed the task of opening collections containing sensitive information by framing the problem as a classification task. We use a novel approach for sensitivity classification using zero-shot generative LLMs. We explore prompt engineering strategies to elicit better responses from these models.
